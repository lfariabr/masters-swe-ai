# 🚀 Ariane 5 Flight 501 – Software Failure Case Study

**Title**: Ariane 5 Disaster  
**Date**: June 4, 1996  
**Source**: ESA, CNES, and Wikipedia Reports  
**Incident**: Ariane 5 exploded 37 seconds after launch, losing a payload worth $500 million.

---

## 📖 Overview

The **Ariane 5** was a European Space Agency (ESA) rocket, intended to carry heavy payloads into orbit.  
However, its maiden flight ended in catastrophic failure due to a **software bug**—making it one of the most infamous examples of **reused code gone wrong**.

- **Failure Cost**: Over $500 million.
- **Payload**: Four cutting-edge satellites.
- **Cause**: An unhandled overflow error in a 16-bit signed integer.

## 🧠 What Went Wrong?

### ❌ Reused Software from Ariane 4
- Engineers reused inertial reference system (SRI) code from Ariane 4 without validating it for Ariane 5’s flight dynamics.
- Ariane 5 had **higher horizontal velocity**, which the old code wasn’t designed to handle.

### ❌ Integer Overflow
- A **horizontal velocity value** tried to convert from a 64-bit float to a 16-bit signed integer.
- This caused an **operand error**, triggering a **system shutdown**.

### ❌ Backup System Failed Too
- The backup SRI system **ran identical software**.
- It failed **in exactly the same way**, within milliseconds.

## 🚨 Chain of Failure

| Step | Fault |
|------|-------|
| 1️⃣  | Software reuses legacy logic without revalidation |
| 2️⃣  | SRI gets invalid data due to overflow |
| 3️⃣  | Primary SRI crashes and sends diagnostic data instead of navigation data |
| 4️⃣  | Rocket interprets this as real input and veers off course |
| 5️⃣  | 37 seconds in: **Self-destruction triggered** to avoid uncontrolled crash |

## 📚 Lessons for SDM & Engineering

- **Reuse ≠ Safe**: Never reuse code blindly across fundamentally different systems.
- **Validate Edge Cases**: Always test for data ranges in real-world conditions.
- **Redundancy Must Be Diverse**: A backup system that fails the same way is not a backup.
- **Error Handling is Critical**: A single unhandled exception can destroy a billion-dollar mission.
- **Risk Analysis**: Must extend beyond physical systems into software subsystems.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

| Field              | Value |
|--------------------|-------|
| Error Type         | Operand error (numeric overflow) |
| Faulty Module      | Inertial Reference System (SRI) |
| Data               | Horizontal velocity conversion |
| Expected Range     | Within 16-bit signed integer |
| Actual Value       | Exceeded maximum (over 32,768) |
| Language           | Ada |

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

- The cost of ignoring **software testing** and **exception handling** can be catastrophic.
- This was **not a hardware problem**—it was **entirely preventable in software**.
- Backup systems should use **diversified implementations**.
- It’s not enough to ask “Does this work?” — you must ask “In what conditions might this fail?”

## 🤹 Fun Curiosities

- Ariane 5 exploded **only 37 seconds** after launch—but took **10 years to develop**.
- The critical software **was still running post-crash** and recorded its own demise.
- The event was so impactful that it became part of **textbooks in software reliability**.
- ESA released a public post-mortem—**rare transparency** for a space agency.

## 🧠 Reflection

The Ariane 5 case is a landmark in software engineering history. It reminds us that **rockets may fail for the same reason as web apps**: poor exception handling, lazy reuse, and untested assumptions.  
Even aerospace-grade systems aren’t safe from basic programming errors.
