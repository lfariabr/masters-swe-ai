Script Outline:

Slide 1 – Introduction (0:00 – 0:30)
“Hello, we are [Team Name], and this is our project TTrack – Torrens Degree Tracker.”
“TTrack helps students and academic staff automatically match their transcripts with the official curriculum, track progress, and identify missing or elective subjects.”

Slide 2 – Project Goals (0:30 – 1:00)
“Our goal was to save time and increase accuracy in academic progress tracking by automating what is currently a manual process.”
“We aimed to create a desktop application that works on both Windows and macOS, with a user-friendly interface, sample data support, and reusable matching logic.”

Slide 3 – Project Management Process (1:00 – 1:40)
“We followed an agile approach with sprints:
Sprint 1: UI/UX design and mock data integration.
Sprint 2: Database scaffolding and matching engine.
Sprint 3: Cross-platform distribution and polishing.”
“We used GitFlow for version control, maintained coding standards, and implemented QA checks before each milestone.”

Slide 4 – Feature Demonstration (1:40 – 4:30)
(Here, you switch to live demo)
“Here’s TTrack’s main interface, built with PyQt.”
“We can load a student transcript and the prescribed curriculum using these file inputs.”
“The matching engine automatically categorizes subjects as completed or missing, checks prerequisites, and suggests electives.”
“Here is the progress summary dashboard, showing completion percentage by semester and subject type.”
“The results can be exported for record-keeping and future reference.”

Slide 5 – Conclusion (4:30 – 5:00)
“TTrack delivers faster, more accurate progress tracking and reduces administrative workload.”
“We believe this tool can be extended for other degree programs and integrated into institutional systems in the future.”
“Thank you for watching, and we are happy to take any questions.”
