## ‚úÖ Feature Progress

### ‚úî Done

#### üü¢ v3.0.0 - `feature/structure-reorganization`
- Core, Services and Controllers directories created and restructured, looking more professional

#### üü¢ v3.1.0 - `feature/login-authentication`
- created tab_login for ui and login_controller for logic
- did some research on supabase auth thinking about Torrens Microsoft Integration (https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth)

#### üü¢ v3.2.0 - `feature/login-authentication`
> Goal: Make it possible for users to register/login on the app via tab and save users on db.
- Created `AuthService` class and integrated it in `main_window`
- Created `LoginController` class, child of AuthService
- Implemented the login, register and logout logic to use in `tab_login.py`

#### üü¢ v3.3.0 - `feature/basic-history-view`
> Goal: Let users retrieve previously saved sessions.
- Update tab "Student Records" to show a list of saved records instead of mock data
- Fetch and repopulate transcript + curriculum tables
- Show timestamp, file summary, match summary
- Main changes:
  - Added `get_processed_data()` method to `DatabaseManager` for loading specific session details
  - Added `fetch_user_history()` to retrieve all sessions tied to the logged-in user
  - Added `get_entry_by_id()` to retrieve session by unique ID (for future deep linking)
  - Added `delete_entry()` for removing obsolete or unwanted sessions (planned feature integration)

#### üü¢ v3.4.0 - `feature/cloud-sync`(Cloud Sync: Fallback and Encryption)
> Goal: Prepare app to run with DB even when offline or in fallback mode.
- Provide fallback to save processed data in CSV if cloud is unavailable
- Abstract DB calls with try/except wrappers
- SyncService created to handle cloud sync logic, but not in use. Studying.
- SyncStatusWidget created to display sync status and progress, but not in use. Studying.

#### üü¢ v3.5.0 - `feature/database-url-secrets`
> Goal: Add .env support for database URL/secrets.
- add dotenv in main.py
- enhance .env.example
- update TTrack.spec and TTrack-macOs.spec 
- create docs/BUILD.md
- make downloaded app authentication work

#### üü¢ v3.6.0 - `feature/login-ux`
> Goal: improve UX with cool buttons and dialogs
- fine tuning for login and logout
- tabs should be hidden when not logged in and login tab disappear when logged in (work on tab_controller.py)

#### üü¢ v3.7.0 - `feature/pitch-deck`
> Goal: Show off project
- fine tune web form: https://forms.gle/zaH4BGeibhDrfVcL8
- schedule in advance (check with Dr. Atif)
- draw a PPT to display on the meeting with a "FOR DUMMIES" version of the TTrack
- story telling:
- from PM to SWE focused on backend
- Data from Torrens & curiosity for process improvement & automation
- draw what I think is current flow (W/O app and compare it with app)

#### üü¢ v3.8.0 - `feature/basic-history-view`
> Goal: improve UX with cool buttons and dialogs
- UX because results_data, summary_data and electives_data json needs to be treated for better displaying
- add "Credit Points" and "Student Name" to Student Records table (when saving, on database and exhibition @ student recordes)
- increase the size of the tables displayed in table results for a height of minimum 50 pixels each
- when clicking LOGGED IN and clicking on "Process Data", user should be sent to Results, not to Student Records

#### üü¢ v3.9.0 - `hotfix/database-url-secrets` 
> Goal: encrypt .env automatically on .exe/app files
- Encrypt password
- Incorporate encryption in build process
- Make unecessary for user to manually edit or insert .env
```bash Run macOs build
python encrypt_env.py
pyinstaller TTrack-macOs.spec
```
```bash Run Windows build
python encrypt_env.py
pyinstaller TTrack.spec
```

#### üü¢ v3.10.0 -`feature/engine-matching`: 
> Goal: Adjust engine matching with PDF provided by Dr. Atif for Masters in IT
- Map out .pdf of course
- Update `engine.py` logic with `suggest_electives_v2`, `match_transcript_with_curriculum_v2` and `generate_progress_summary_v2`
- Update `data_processor.py` logic with `process_data_v2`, `save_session_to_database_v2`
- Upgrade displayed info for final user
- Summary of what has been done on the algorithm:
```Python
# 1) load the canonical structures
curriculum_df = load_curriculum_df()
elective_bank_df = load_elective_bank_df()

# 2) your transcript_df must have at least ['Subject Code'] (and ideally 'Subject Name')
# transcript_df = pd.read_csv(...)

# 3) match
result_df = match_transcript_with_curriculum_v2(transcript_df, curriculum_df, elective_bank_df)

# 4) summary + suggestions
summary_df = generate_progress_summary_v2(result_df)
recs_df = suggest_electives_v2(result_df, elective_bank_df, transcript_df, max_electives=3)
```

#### üü¢ v3.11.0 - `feature/engine-adit`
> Goal: Integrate ADIT course structure to the system 
- [X] create data/courses/adit21.py to be used
- [X] import specific functions at data_processor for testing and easy usage
- [X] Update curriculum .xlsx to be exactly like MSIT course and make it appear on tab input

#### üü¢ v3.11.1 - `feature/engine-version-two`
> Goal: Display hardcoded transcript on sample data table instead of xlsx: 
- [X] create `load_sample_file_hardcoded` on `tab_input.py` to be used at `Connect helper buttons` section ***- line 112***
- [X] create `load_as_model_hardcoded(is_transcript=True)` on `utils.py` ***- line 31***
- [X] create `load_curriculum_and_bank_same_df` at `msit_ad.py`
- [X] create `load_curriculum_and_bank_adit_same_df` at `adit21.py`
- [X] plugged `load_curr_and_bank` at utils.py load_as_model_hardcoded to test
- [X] double check if `load_sample_file_hardcoded` is with expected behaviour
- [X] double check if `load_as_model_hardcoded` at `utils.py` is with expected behaviour

#### üü¢ v3.11.2 - `feature/student-records-display`
> Goal: Update Student Records saving and displaying data
- [X] update "Student Records" tab when nothing's loaded (columns 5... to current existing ones...) 
- [X] update student_records table adding new columns via SQL
- [X] Save Course Name on database 
- [X] Save Student ID on database

#### ‚öôÔ∏è v3.12.0 - `feature/course-selection`

- [X] Adjust pytest.ini to remove all deprecation warnings and features
- [X] Add coverage to Core component
- [ ] Add coverage to Services component
- [ ] Add coverage to Controllers component

- `feature/database-persistence`: use SyncService and SyncStatusWidget for local data persistence
- `feature/auto-detect-os-theme`: Auto detect os theme
