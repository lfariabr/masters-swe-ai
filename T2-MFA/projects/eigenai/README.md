# EigenAI Project Concept

EigenAI plays on "eigenvaleus" and AI foundations".

It is a learning assistant web app for Torrens students doing math/programming mix in MFA501.

The app will act as a companion tutor that walks students through each problem set interactively â€” showing process, formulas, and results with animations.
