# Mathematical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence

## Introduction
The purpose of this subject is to provide a solid mathematical background that students will encounter in studies of Artificial Intelligence, specifically in sub-areas such as machine learning, natural language processing, speech recognition, and computer vision. This subject will cover topics on linear algebra (equations, functions and graphs), differentiation and optimisation, vectors and matrices, statistics and probabilities. Thorough understanding of these mathematical concepts is necessary for a good grasp of the inner workings of the algorithms in Artificial Intelligence.
