## Assessment 2A
### Assessment 2: **Problem Sets Brief** 
Assessment: Problem Sets
Length: _
Due Date: 16/10/2025

#### Summary: 
In this assessment, you'll be given a wide range of programming exercises to complete, which require using and applying math concepts. They'll be submitted in module 6 and in module 10. The assessment is to be completed individually and you're to submit a zip file including source code, debug and release build + supporting documents for each problem set.

#### Context:
This assessment activity assesses your skills in employing AI mathematical foundation to solve real-world problems and scenarios. The assessment is made of two parts due in modules 6 and 10 over the course of trimester.

#### Instructions:
- The programs that you submit should be free of warnings and errors.
- You need to submit the source code and the executable format.
    - Name the source code folder as: MFA501_Assessment2_Week6_LastName_FirstName.zip and MFA501_Assessment2_Week10_LastName_FirstName.zip
- Your code should be structured and written with the best practices in the field of programming.
- There should be enough number of comments in the source files to show your understanding of the program. Any third-part code should be appropriately attributed.

After implementation and testing your programs, write a reflective report detailing the experience of the development process. The report needs to be at least 500 words in length and include the following sections:
- Overview
- Justifications and elaborations on the mathematical approaches and models used to solve the cases study
- Justifications and elaborations on the programing methods and practices used to implement the mathematical approaches and models
- What went right
- What went wrong
- What you are not sure about
- Conclusion

Your problem sets should include the following elements and should be zipped prior to submission:
- Release Build Zip: A release build executable must be zipped and included with the submission. Ensure that project settings are set to Release when creating this build.
- Source Code Zip: All relevant source code files and project files must be zipped and included with the submission
- Reflective report: PDF or Word
- Naming & File structure for the zip file (should be done for all problem sets) .
    - MFA501_Assessment2_Set1_Release Build_LastName_FirstName.zip
    - MFA501_Assessment2_Set1_Source_LastName_FirstName.zip
    - MFA501_Assessment2_Set1_report_LastName_Firstname.pdf or .docx
- Make sure to submit Problem Set 1 by Sunday 11:55pm Module 6
- Make sure to submit Problem Set 2 by Sunday 11:55pm Module 10

#### Submission Instructions
This assessment task is due in two stages throughout the trimester as outlined above. Please submit your completed assessments via the Assessment link in the main navigation menu in MFA501

Mathematical Foundations of AI. The Learning Facilitator will provide feedback via the Grade Centre on Blackboard. Feedback can be viewed in My Grades

#### Assessment 2A
Instructions for Assessment 2-Part A.
1. Assessment due date: Sunday 11:55 pm - Week 6
2. Weight: 20%
3. You are given a set of programming exercises (Set 1) (with 2 exercises).
4. Write the code for these 2 exercises (10% for each).
5. Using toolbox/functions/libraries for the related assignments (instead of writing the code yourself) does not align with the requirements of this assessment.
6. Submission Format: You need to submit two zip files (i.e., “Problem 1” and “Problem 2”).
- Each zip file should include the following for the relevant problem:
    - a. Release Build: An executable release build must be included with the submission. Ensure project settings are set to Release when creating this build.
    - b. Source Code: All relevant source code files and project files.
    - c. Reflective Report (Word): This should provide a detailed account of your research, critical analysis, findings, results, and references. This report should be at the postgraduate level. It should also contain your algorithm and why you have chosen this method over other methods.
    - d. A video of the program's run: You need to record your screen while running the program and fully demonstrate the correct execution of your code with the results.
    - e. Your code is in a text file, so the system automatically checks the AI issues.
7. For further information, you may refer to the assessment brief.

##### **Set 1**
1. Write a program based on a recursive function to calculate the determinant of a nxn general matrix
2. Write a program to find the Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, and Eigenspaces of a nxn general matrix

##### **Set 2**
1. Write a program to calculate the Integral of a general function
2. Write a program that calculates the gradient for RRBF_type1 or RRBF_type2 (choose the one you prefer). Refer to this paper: https://research.ijcaonline.org/volume92/number3/pxc3894955.pdf
