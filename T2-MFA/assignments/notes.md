# My Notes for the Assignments of Mathematical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence

## Assessment 2A
### Assessment 2: **Problem Sets Brief** 
Assessment: Problem Sets
Length: _
Due Date: 16/10/2025

#### Summary: 
In this assessment, you'll be given a wide range of programming exercises to complete, which require using and applying math concepts. They'll be submitted in module 6 and in module 10. The assessment is to be completed individually and you're to submit a zip file including source code, debug and release build + supporting documents for each problem set.

#### Context:
This assessment activity assesses your skills in employing AI mathematical foundation to solve real-world problems and scenarios. The assessment is made of two parts due in modules 6 and 10 over the course of trimester.

#### Instructions:
- The programs that you submit should be free of warnings and errors.
- You need to submit the source code and the executable format.
    - Name the source code folder as: MFA501_Assessment2_Week6_LastName_FirstName.zip and MFA501_Assessment2_Week10_LastName_FirstName.zip
- Your code should be structured and written with the best practices in the field of programming.
- There should be enough number of comments in the source files to show your understanding of the program. Any third-part code should be appropriately attributed.

After implementation and testing your programs, write a reflective report detailing the experience of the development process. The report needs to be at least 500 words in length and include the following sections:
- Overview
- Justifications and elaborations on the mathematical approaches and models used to solve the cases study
- Justifications and elaborations on the programing methods and practices used to implement the mathematical approaches and models
- What went right
- What went wrong
- What you are not sure about
- Conclusion

Your problem sets should include the following elements and should be zipped prior to submission:
- Release Build Zip: A release build executable must be zipped and included with the submission. Ensure that project settings are set to Release when creating this build.
- Source Code Zip: All relevant source code files and project files must be zipped and included with the submission
- Reflective report: PDF or Word
- Naming & File structure for the zip file (should be done for all problem sets) .
    - MFA501_Assessment2_Set1_Release Build_LastName_FirstName.zip
    - MFA501_Assessment2_Set1_Source_LastName_FirstName.zip
    - MFA501_Assessment2_Set1_report_LastName_Firstname.pdf or .docx
- Make sure to submit Problem Set 1 by Sunday 11:55pm Module 6
- Make sure to submit Problem Set 2 by Sunday 11:55pm Module 10

#### Submission Instructions
This assessment task is due in two stages throughout the trimester as outlined above. Please submit your completed assessments via the Assessment link in the main navigation menu in MFA501

Mathematical Foundations of AI. The Learning Facilitator will provide feedback via the Grade Centre on Blackboard. Feedback can be viewed in My Grades

## Assessment 3
### Assessment 3: **Project Brief** 
Assessment: Solve an AI Problem set
Length: _
Due Date: 03/12/2025

#### Summary: 
The second assessment allowed you to show your understanding on how to choose the correct AI method to solve simple case studies. Assessment 3 has been designed to assess your ability in choosing and using the best AI methods to solve larger and more challenging problems. The AI method that you will be using is more challenging to implement as compared to those in the second assessment. Solving real-world problems using AI techniques requires more sophisticated skills, and you will demonstrate these in this assessment.

Your subject facilitator will provide you with the scenario/topic/focus for this assessment during the first few weeks of this subject. Regardless of the content that will be provided, you will have to first understand the problem and formulate it in a suitable manner for AI techniques. The next step is to choose the correct AI method to solve the problem. As a part of development, you have to test and analyse the performance of the AI technique to ensure that it gives optimal results. In summary, you will be required to program an AI method, solve a problem using it, and write a reflective report.

#### Context:
Facilitator will advise you of the exact task you are required to complete during the first few weeks of the subject.

#### Instructions:
The source code that you will be submitting should be free of build warnings, build errors, and all intermediate files (.obj, .pdb, etc), crashes, and errors (compile, run-time, logical, etc.). Your code should be structured and written with the best practices in the field of programming. There should
be enough number of comments in the source files to show your understanding of the program. Any third-party code should be appropriately attributed.

When you submit the electronic version of your project make sure to use the following names:
- Name the source code folder as: Source â€“ Student Name
- Name the solution as: YourGameName.sln

#### Submission Instructions
You are supposed to submit a ZIP file including:
- Release Build Zip: A release build executable must be zipped and included with the submission. Ensure that project settings are set to Release when creating this build.
- Source Code Zip: All relevant source code files and project files must be zipped and included with the submission
- Reflective report: PDF or Word
- Naming & File structure for the zip file.
