🎯 Goals.md – Youtube Channel Project

🧠 Vision

Create a content-rich YouTube channel that documents my journey through the Master of Software Engineering (Artificial Intelligence, Advanced) at Torrens University. This channel will act as a public learning journal, a technical portfolio, and a resource hub for aspiring software engineers and AI practitioners.

🗂️ Content Pillars

1. Academic Journey
	•	Document subjects as I go through each trimester
	•	Share assignment breakdowns, challenges, and lessons learned
	•	Explain complex concepts in a simple, engaging way
	•	Reflect on exams, projects, and academic milestones

2. Technical Tutorials
	•	Explain core software engineering concepts (e.g. OOP, REST, CI/CD)
	•	Build mini-projects using Python, Django, FastAPI, React, etc.
	•	Share AI/ML experiments using tools like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
	•	Include real code walkthroughs and GitHub repo links

3. Career and Growth
	•	Share tips for switching careers into software/AI
	•	Talk about internship/job hunting strategies in Australia
	•	Discuss visa, migration, and PR journey as an international student
	•	Reflect on soft skills and mindset shifts during the course

4. Behind the Scenes
	•	Productivity hacks for balancing study/work/content
	•	How I organize my notes, projects, GitHub repos
	•	Equipment, tools, and software I use for development and video creation
