# Intelligent Systems - ISY503
## Dr. Nandini Sidnal

## Module 1 - The Nature and Purpose of Intelligent Systems

### TLDR
Intelligent systems are built on machine learning (ML), which has four core learning paradigms: **supervised** (task-driven, labelled data), **unsupervised** (data-driven, unlabelled), **semi-supervised** (hybrid), and **reinforcement** (environment-driven, reward/penalty). This module introduces these foundations alongside real-world applications (cybersecurity, healthcare, IoT, NLP) and the ethical considerations that must guide AI deployment — including fairness, bias, and differential privacy. ISY503 focuses primarily on supervised learning and models, with reinforcement learning for AI agents.

### Introduction
Intelligent systems have been studied in the following areas: speech recognition, computer vision and natural language processing. This subject focuses primarily on computer vision and natural language processing, as the field of speech recognition is nested in these two main areas. It also covers the basics of machine learning (ML), as intelligent systems are based on ML.

This module is an introduction to intelligent systems. It will provide you with an understanding of the reasoning behind intelligent systems and their applications. The essential resources included in this Module will help you to understand the complexities of implementing intelligent systems and the ethical principles that need to be considered in their application. This module will also help you prepare for the first assessment—a case study based on an intelligent system.

*Resource Overview:*

    Intelligent systems depend on the learning ability of computers and machines. There are four main machine learning approaches for intelligent systems: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning. You are probably familiar with reinforcement learning, as it is the basis for artificial intelligent (AI) agents and environment discovery in this subject. However, this subject mainly focuses on supervised learning and models. Please read the contents of the following webpage to further develop your understanding of the differences between these approaches and the machine learning models that each of them commonly use.

### Learning Activities

#### Activity 1: Introduce Yourself
Write a short paragraph about yourself in the ‘Introduce Yourself’ discussion forum. The ‘Introduce Yourself’ discussion forum is a great way for students to get to know each other and feel part of the college community. It will help you to join with others to create study groups and support each other outside of class time. The forum has the potential to provide supportive friendships throughout the course.

> *Status: ✅ Done*

#### Activity 2: Discussion Forum Post
Consider the following situation:

A bank is using an intelligent system to grant loans. The bank gives each customer a form to complete. In the form, one question asks the customers to give reasons as to why they will not be late in repaying the loan instalments. The system uses computer vision to read the hand-writing of the customer. It also uses natural language processing to sense the feeling of their writing (e.g., if it is polite, friendly, formal, etc.). After a year in which 2,000 loan forms were collected, the bank trains a ML algorithm to grant loans only to those customers whose writing shares a similar feeling, as such customers are never late in their loan repayments.

- Using the resources you have read in this Module, discuss the ethics of the situation given above. Ensure you also discuss the concept of fairness in the scenario.
- Describe each of these (ethics and fairness) in no more than 100 words.
- Post your answer to the Module 1 discussion forum.

## Module 2 - Introduction to Machine Learning

### TLDR

- **Supervised learning** maps labelled input **features (X)** to output **targets (Y)** — classification produces a discrete class label; regression produces a continuous number.
- Data must be split into **training** (model learns from this) and **testing** (true generalisation measure) sets before fitting any model; mixing them causes optimistic bias (**data leakage**).
- Core evaluation metrics all derive from the **confusion matrix** (TP, TN, FP, FN): accuracy (balanced data), precision (FP-sensitive), recall (FN-sensitive), F1 (imbalanced data), and AUC (threshold-independent comparison).
- **Overfitting** — great training accuracy, poor test accuracy — is countered by **feature selection** (remove irrelevant/redundant features via filter/wrapper/embedded methods) and regularisation.
- **Categorical features** must be encoded numerically before most ML algorithms can process them; key strategies are **Label Encoding** (integers) and **One-Hot Encoding** (binary columns), with **target encoding** (regularised) best for high-cardinality features.
- For **reinforcement learning**, rewards replace labelled targets — the reward function quality determines learning quality; for **unsupervised learning** (clustering), internal metrics (Silhouette, Davies-Bouldin) evaluate structure quality without ground-truth labels.

### Introduction
In this Module, you will learn about the basics of machine learning (ML). Intelligent systems are based on computers’ or machines’ perceptions about the world. Thus, ML plays an important role in intelligent systems. In this Module, we focus on the supervised learning part of ML. Supervised learning requires labelled data to make a relation between the input variables and output variables. 
- **The inputs are called features** and the **outputs are called targets**. 
- The algorithms that find the **relations between features and targets are called classifiers**. 
Based on the relation they find, they can classify or predict the outcome of data they have not seen previously. There are numerous classifiers, each of which has different specifications. Based on the given labelled data, they can make mistakes when predicting the outcome of a new data. To evaluate their performance, some data can be given to them as a training dataset so they can find the relation. Afterwards, their performance will be measured by administering a testing dataset. This Module also discusses how to split a given dataset into training and testing datasets. The performance of classifiers on training and testing datasets are measured by ML metrics. You will examine each metric in further detail in this Module, which will help you to better understand your case study for your first assessment.

*Resource Overview:*

    Please read the following article, which examines types of categorical data encoding. Categorical data need to be encoded as numerical data, as the language of machines is based on numbers. At a minimum, you need to fully understand Integer Encoding (commonly known as Label Encoding) and Indicator Encoding (commonly known as One-Hot Encoding), as you will need to be able to decide which one to use in different situations to train your ML model. This is a long paper, try not to be overwhelmed by the discussions on coding. You do not need to understand the coding of each section; rather, try to focus on understanding the concepts and the output after encoding.

*Resource Overview:*

   On the first page of this article, please read from the section entitled ‘What is overfitting?’ to the section entitled ‘A Toy Example’. Overfitting occurs when your model appears to perform very well with the training data with which it was provided; however, when new data is used to test your model, the model poorly predicts the outputs. Thus, you need to understand the factors that cause overfitting so that you can avoid them.

Retrieved from https://go.openathens.net/redirector/torrens.edu.au?url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045790613003066

*Resource Overview:*

    The following article describes several feature selection methods. In this Module, we will focus on filtering methods based on correlations. This approach will reduce the chance of overfitting; however, at some point, you also have to stop removing features to avoid underfitting. Underfitting means that your model performs better if you give it more data and features for training. Thus, choosing the best features depends on ranking the features. To understand how it works, you need to read the section entitled ‘Filter Methods’ in the article; the first three paragraphs are especially important to understanding the idea behind feature selection and feature ranking. Please read the next paragraph to understand the mathematics of feature selection and feature ranking.

It is now a good time to undertake some further independent research. In this learning activity, you should undertake a web search to learn about the limitations of the metrics of ML. Metrics describe how well your model understands a problem and makes a decision. However, not every metric is suitable for every situation. The article in the additional resource section outlines a case scenario in which the ROC curve cannot be used as a good metric. ROC curves have been employed in psychophysics to assess human (and occasionally non-human or animal) detection of weak signals. Please read the article, understand the situation, summarise the article and, in 100 words, explain how the authors discovered that this metric was not suitable to their problem. You need to upload your summary to the Metrics Suitability discussion forum in this Module.

Write a summary of at least 100 words.

Post your summary to the Module 2: Metrics Suitability Discussion Forum. Read through the posts of your peers. Do you all share the same view of how the authors discovered that this metric was unsuitable? If not, why not? Comment on the post of at least one other person.

The metrics discussed in this Module were mainly directed at supervised learning. For other approaches, such as reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning, other types of metrics should be applied, as the value of targets or outcomes are not available as they are for supervised learning. To understand the metrics of unsupervised learning, you need to read and summarise the following articles. Read the summaries of your peers. You may find that they have captured the essence of an article succinctly or these summaries may be helpful if you have not quite understood something.

Write two summaries of at least 100 words for each paper.

Post your two summaries to the Module 2: Unsupervised Metrics Discussion Forum (i.e., one summary on reinforcement learning and another summary on unsupervised learning metrics).
