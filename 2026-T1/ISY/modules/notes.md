# Intelligent Systems - ISY503
## Dr. Nandini Sidnal

## Module 1 - The Nature and Purpose of Intelligent Systems

### TLDR
Intelligent systems are built on machine learning (ML), which has four core learning paradigms: **supervised** (task-driven, labelled data), **unsupervised** (data-driven, unlabelled), **semi-supervised** (hybrid), and **reinforcement** (environment-driven, reward/penalty). This module introduces these foundations alongside real-world applications (cybersecurity, healthcare, IoT, NLP) and the ethical considerations that must guide AI deployment — including fairness, bias, and differential privacy. ISY503 focuses primarily on supervised learning and models, with reinforcement learning for AI agents.

### Introduction
Intelligent systems have been studied in the following areas: speech recognition, computer vision and natural language processing. This subject focuses primarily on computer vision and natural language processing, as the field of speech recognition is nested in these two main areas. It also covers the basics of machine learning (ML), as intelligent systems are based on ML.

This module is an introduction to intelligent systems. It will provide you with an understanding of the reasoning behind intelligent systems and their applications. The essential resources included in this Module will help you to understand the complexities of implementing intelligent systems and the ethical principles that need to be considered in their application. This module will also help you prepare for the first assessment—a case study based on an intelligent system.

### Resources

#### 1. Overview of Intelligent Systems and Approaches
- Sarker, I. H. (2001). Machine learning: Algorithms, real-world applications and research directions. SN Computer Science, 2(3), 160. https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/machine-learning-algorithms-real-world/docview/2933400158/se-2?accountid=176901

*Resource Overview:*

    Intelligent systems depend on the learning ability of computers and machines. There are four main machine learning approaches for intelligent systems: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning. You are probably familiar with reinforcement learning, as it is the basis for artificial intelligent (AI) agents and environment discovery in this subject. However, this subject mainly focuses on supervised learning and models. Please read the contents of the following webpage to further develop your understanding of the differences between these approaches and the machine learning models that each of them commonly use.

- Magnimid. (2019, 15 March). 10 powerful examples of AI applications in today's world. Retrieved https://becominghuman.ai/10-powerful-examples-of-ai-applications-553f7f062d9f

*Resource Overview:*

    Please read the contents of the following webpage. In this short reading, you will be introduced to 10 AI applications. You will begin to appreciate the varied and far-reaching influence of AI. It also contains an interesting 10-minute video at the end (use the link to the YouTube video rather than the link to the Twitter video), which describes the applications in detail. At the end of the video, there are references to the negative applications of AI that could be detrimental to human society. This will get you thinking about the ethics of AI.

*Resource Overview:*

    In this short reading, you are introduced to the world of academic literature. It might seem simple, but there is a skill to being able to read academic articles and this is a good place to start. This paper will help you to understand other published works on intelligent systems so that you can summarise the findings of other authors' work. You will also develop knowledge on determining suitable approaches to build AI systems.

*Resource Overview:*

    Please listen to this podcast. As you listen, you will be introduced to the ethics of AI. This podcast will help you to understand some ethical issues that arise in relation to AI, including fairness (at 20–26 minutes), which is the idea that your algorithm will not be biased in production, and differential privacy (at 26–30 minutes), which relates to the sharing of datasets without revealing any information that could harm the privacy of the participants in the dataset. You will also develop knowledge of how ethics can affect intelligent systems and AI.

### Learning Activities

#### Activity 1: Introduce Yourself
Write a short paragraph about yourself in the ‘Introduce Yourself’ discussion forum. The ‘Introduce Yourself’ discussion forum is a great way for students to get to know each other and feel part of the college community. It will help you to join with others to create study groups and support each other outside of class time. The forum has the potential to provide supportive friendships throughout the course.

#### Activity 2: Discussion Forum Post
Consider the following situation:

A bank is using an intelligent system to grant loans. The bank gives each customer a form to complete. In the form, one question asks the customers to give reasons as to why they will not be late in repaying the loan instalments. The system uses computer vision to read the hand-writing of the customer. It also uses natural language processing to sense the feeling of their writing (e.g., if it is polite, friendly, formal, etc.). After a year in which 2,000 loan forms were collected, the bank trains a ML algorithm to grant loans only to those customers whose writing shares a similar feeling, as such customers are never late in their loan repayments.

- Using the resources you have read in this Module, discuss the ethics of the situation given above. Ensure you also discuss the concept of fairness in the scenario.
- Describe each of these (ethics and fairness) in no more than 100 words.
- Post your answer to the Module 1 discussion forum.
- Please read other students’ posts and comment on why you agree or disagree or provide help with other students’ posts.
- Please reply to at least two other students’ posts.
