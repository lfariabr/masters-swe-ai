# Intelligent Systems - ISY503

## Subject Introduction
This subject aims to give a broad introduction of intelligent systems, that is, how technologically advanced machines perceive and respond to the world around them. Discussion will focus on how Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts are used to design intelligent systems. Overview of AI topics such as representation, reasoning, search methods, intelligent agents, machine learning, uncertainties and probabilities, perception and action, and communication will be presented. It also includes discussions of AI topics such as Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition, Expert Systems, Computer Vision, and how they are used to develop intelligent systems. This subject also aims to address the particular ethical issues that AI presents and how it can be used to benefit society.
