# Cloud Computing Fundamentals - CCF501
## Dr. Divya Leekha

## Module 1 - Traditional vs Modern Computing

### TLDR
Cloud Computing Fundamentals: From hardware rental to business agility
- Three service models (SaaS/PaaS/IaaS) = different levels of abstraction
- Deployment types: Private (your data center), Public (vendor managed), Hybrid (mix)
- Main drivers: Cost reduction, capacity planning, organizational agility
- Built on: Virtualization (share hardware efficiently) + SOA (modular services)
- Evolution: Mainframes → Client-Server → Internet/WWW → Cloud (back to centralized, but distributed)

### Introduction
During the past two decades, the IT and telecom sectors have taken a huge leap in terms of development. New devices have evolved - like tablets, Internet of Things-based (IoT) wearable technologies, AR/VR devices, smart phones, and more. Access to the internet has been simplified, made easy and economical. Simultaneously, the applications and user demands have made underlying algorithms complex. New experiences like virtual reality and the trend to include artificial intelligence in applications have increased the need for higher computational power. The popularity of wearables and linked devices like the Google Home Mini or Alexa has meant that IoT is generating more data. All of this is then feeding AI systems essential to support these IoT devices’  learning capabilities. Applications of the Internet have evolved from search and email to videos, financial applications, video games, etc. Platforms are now not only computers but mobile phones, tablets and AR lenses.

The computing model has also changed to keep up with the demands and expectations of consumers. Rather than being distributed in nature, a more centralised approach – in the form of cloud computing is becoming increasingly popular as this requires less computational and storage capabilities on user terminals and more on the centralised system (cloud). This in turn makes user terminals less expensive and simple and at the same time makes it cost effective for developers and businesses to deploy the solutions and offer services efficiently. In addition, business-driven big data necessitate a centralised forest of supercomputers – that is a cloud computing system. Cloud computing aims to provide cost effective resource-rich computing solutions to businesses.

This subject provides a fundamental understanding of cloud computing. You will be able to understand how the cloud computing infrastructure has evolved from the traditional IT infrastructure and what business advantages it brings (including its total cost of ownership). In addition, you will also learn the different cloud segments and cloud deployment models and the key players in the market. This subject also provides knowledge of cloud services and cloud security.

*Resource Overview:*

    Cloud computing has trade-offs. In this resource, we will review some questions that you may need to ask if you are dealing with cloud technologies, and how that may affect your business or impact your clients. Consider questions like:
    - How much can using cloud computing save me; could it be 50% of my costs?
    - Is the cloud actually riskier than traditional options, such as storing data locally?
    - What are the consequences for my business and me if my provider goes offline for just 5 minutes?

#### 5. Cloud Computing and Virtualisation
- Manvi, S., & Shyam, G. K. (2021). Cloud computing: Concepts and technologies. CRC Press. https://learning-oreilly-com.torrens.idm.oclc.org/library/view/cloud-computing/9781000338058/xhtml/04chap_04.xhtml#sec4_1

*Resource Overview:*

    Virtualisation is one of the key technologies that enables cloud computing. In order to understand cloud computing, one must know about the virtualisation technology and how virtualisation is utilised in cloud computing. Please read Section 4.1 “Virtualization Technology” and Section 4.4 “Pros and Cons of Virtualization” of Chapter 4, which provides great insight into virtualisation technology, its characteristics and why it is suitable for use in cloud computing.

### Learning Activities

#### Activity 1: Introduce Yourself
Write a short paragraph about yourself in the Introduce Yourself discussion forum. This is a great way for you to get to know your peers and begin sharing and applying ideas as you study CCF501 together. This forum is the most common way our past IT students at Torrens University got to know their classmates. It is a good chance to start informal study meet-ups and support each other outside of class time. This is also a good way to build your professional network.

In your post, please include a little bit of information about yourself. You can answer questions like:

What industry do you currently work in?
What do you hope to achieve from studying CCF501: Cloud Computing Fundamentals?
What is your current knowledge of cloud computing?
(maybe you know a lot, or perhaps you know very little—either way, welcome to CCF501!)
What is your favourite phone app?

#### Activity 2: Break the Ice—Discussion Forum
To break the ice, it is time to start engaging with your peers here.

Read through four introductions on the Introduce Yourself discussion forum.
Find two people who have a similar background or similar thoughts to you.
Tag them in this discussion forum and outline a current or past problem with traditional IT services you have faced. (This activity aims to find common shortcomings and experiences in using old-fashioned IT models like physical servers, software on DVDs, backup tapes, etc.)
Identify at least two alternative(s) you think cloud computing may offer in your responses to each other.
Post your answer in the Module 1 discussion forum.

#### Activity 3: Thinking Exercise on Total Cost of Ownership—Discussion Forum
One of the top considerations, right off the bat, in investing in new IT services or infrastructure is the total cost of ownership (TCO) of the new project. In this article, Cloud Total Cost of OwnershipLinks to an external site., the authors discuss the ‘economics’ of cloud computing and describe the journey facing companies who consider the adoption of cloud.

Consider this article and your own observations after reading through and watching some of the resources in this module. What advantages (if any) may there be in terms of the TCO of investing in the cloud?

Post your thoughts for this exercise in the Module 1 ‘Thinking Exercise on TCO’ discussion forum.
