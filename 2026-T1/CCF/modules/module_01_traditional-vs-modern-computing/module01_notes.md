## 1. Key Highlights from McHaney (2021) - Chapter 1

### Core Definitions
- **Cloud computing** = Delivering computing services over the Internet (servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics)
- "Cloud" symbol from old flow charts representing the Internet
- Focus areas: **Cost reduction, capacity planning, business agility**

### Cost Considerations
- Two cost types: Purchase costs + Operational costs
- **Operational overhead** often exceeds upfront investment over time
- Includes: personnel, training, upgrades, utilities, security, help desk
- IT costs often viewed as "cost sink" → cloud helps eliminate many expenses

### Capacity Planning Challenges
- **Under-provisioned** = can't meet user needs
- **Over-provisioned** = waste/inefficiency
- Three strategies:
  - **Match**: Add resources incrementally
  - **Lead**: Add capacity in anticipation
  - **Lag**: Add only after capacity reached

### Deployment Models
| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Private** | Internal/enterprise cloud on-premise | Sensitive data, large orgs with IT expertise |
| **Public** | Third-party vendor managed | Shared overhead, less confidential data |
| **Hybrid** | Combines both | Mix of sensitive + flexible needs |

### Service Models (The Big 3)

#### **SaaS (Software as a Service)**
- **What**: Complete applications delivered via browser
- **Examples**: Salesforce, WebEx, Dropbox, Gmail
- **You manage**: Just your data/configurations
- **Benefits**: Instant access, auto-updates, any device
- **Analogy**: Taking the bus 🚌

#### **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**
- **What**: Development platform + runtime environment
- **Examples**: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google App Engine
- **You manage**: Your applications
- **Includes**: Solution stacks (OS + middleware + database + dev tools)
- **Analogy**: Taking a taxi 🚕

#### **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**
- **What**: Virtual hardware/infrastructure
- **Examples**: AWS, Google Cloud Platform, RackSpace
- **You manage**: OS, middleware, applications
- **Billing**: Pay-as-you-go (watch costs!)
- **Analogy**: Leasing a car 🚗

#### **Bonus: RaaS (Recovery as a Service)**
- Backup, disaster recovery, business continuity
- Multiple location backups, rapid resumption

### Key Technologies Enabling Cloud

#### Virtualization
- Commoditizes hardware by sharing resources among users
- **Hypervisor** = software layer emulating hardware (CPU, memory, I/O, networking)
- Originated from mainframe time-sharing
- Enables massive server farms with economies of scale

#### SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)
- Philosophy: Build **reusable, modular services** that communicate over networks
- **Lego block analogy**: Interoperable, composable, reusable, robust
- **Granularity** = level of service detail (small blocks = flexible but complex)
- Services communicate via **messages**, not procedure calls
- 7 Principles: Open standards, platform-neutral, location-transparent, peer-to-peer, loosely coupled, interface-based, coarsely grained

### Historical Evolution
```
1960s → Mainframes (centralized, dedicated)
1970s → Time-shared mainframes (virtual machines, thin clients)
1980s → PCs (desktop power, thick clients)
1990s → Client-Server + Internet/WWW
2005+ → Cloud Computing + Mobile (back to thin clients, shared resources)
```

### Benefits Summary
✅ Fast deployment  
✅ Access from anywhere, any device  
✅ Elastic scaling (up/down as needed)  
✅ Cost efficiency for small/temp projects  
✅ Expert infrastructure without in-house staff  
✅ Pay-only-for-what-you-use billing  

### Disadvantages to Watch
⚠️ Network dependency (no internet = no access)  
⚠️ Security complexity (access control, data protection)  
⚠️ Costs can accumulate (pay-as-you-go adds up)  
⚠️ Vulnerability to attacks (online target)  
⚠️ Loss of control (third-party governance)  
⚠️ Technical problem dependency on vendor

## 4. Key Highlights from Accenture Technology. (2020, June 5)

1. It's fast.
Cloud offers the flexibility to quickly adjust the amount of computing resources a business needs, while paying only for what it uses.
Because the cost and time it takes to develop and deploy new applications is lower, it allows faster speed to market.

2. It enables innovation.
Cloud provides affordable, unrestricted access, to cutting edge technologies and capabilities.
This gives businesses capabilities that would normally be out of reach, reducing their barriers to entry.

3. You choose the scale.
Cloud lets businesses scale up or down.
When there are people around the world that need access to data and apps the cloud provides companies with the tools to do business globally.

4. It'll save you money.
Building a proprietary IT infrastructure and staffing it is incredibly expensive and a business might not always use it fully.
With an optimized cloud environment a company can focus on its core business and pay only for the computing resources that it uses.
