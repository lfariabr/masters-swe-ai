#### Summary:

This paper investigates how quality management in higher education institutions can be systematically planned and improved using a system dynamics (SD) modelling approach. The authors argue that higher education operates as a complex system influenced by multiple interdependent factors, and that traditional, infrastructure-heavy improvement strategies are insufficient for achieving sustainable quality outcomes.

The study adopts Total Quality Management (TQM) principles and bases its quality framework on the ABET accreditation criteria. Eight key dimensions are modelled, including governance, teaching–learning processes, student entry and outcomes, faculty contribution, facilities and technical support, curriculum, program educational objectives, and continuous improvement. These factors are represented through causal loop diagrams and stock-and-flow models to capture reinforcing and balancing feedback loops over time.

Using simulation, the authors evaluate different improvement scenarios by varying the rate of investment in facilities versus other quality factors. The results demonstrate that increasing infrastructure alone does not significantly accelerate overall institutional performance. Instead, the most effective strategy for newly established institutions is a moderate annual increase in facilities (approximately 30%), combined with a stronger and sustained focus (around 40%) on non-infrastructure dimensions such as governance, teaching quality, curriculum, and continuous improvement practices.

The findings highlight the importance of time-based decision-making in quality management, showing that institutional performance improvements occur with measurable delays depending on the chosen strategy. The paper concludes that system dynamics modelling provides valuable decision-support for educational leaders, enabling a holistic and evidence-based approach to planning quality improvement initiatives. The authors suggest future work extending the model to incorporate additional quality factors and to further optimise the balance of improvement efforts.

#### Why This Links to StC:

The relevance of this study to StC lies in its treatment of educational quality as a dynamic, system-wide process rather than a static or infrastructure-driven outcome. StC operates within a complex ecosystem involving students, parents, teachers, leadership, and support services, where changes in one area (e.g. communication, teaching practices, or feedback mechanisms) have delayed and compounding effects across the institution.

The system dynamics approach presented in this paper aligns closely with the challenges faced in a contemporary school environment, where large volumes of qualitative and quantitative data are generated continuously (e.g. satisfaction surveys, engagement indicators, academic performance, attendance, and operational feedback). The paper’s emphasis on reinforcing and balancing feedback loops provides a strong theoretical foundation for modelling how these signals interact over time at StC.

In particular, the findings challenge the assumption that quality improvement is primarily driven by investment in physical facilities. This is directly applicable to StC, where many quality-related outcomes are influenced more heavily by factors such as teaching–learning processes, communication quality, staff engagement, and continuous improvement practices. These dimensions are already measurable through existing school data sources and can be integrated into a system-level quality model.

The proposed system dynamics framework also supports the development of AI-enabled decision-support tools, such as stakeholder-specific insights for parents, students, and teachers. By modelling delays, trends, and interactions between quality factors, StC could move beyond reactive reporting toward proactive, data-informed interventions. This aligns with the school’s interest in early-warning indicators, engagement monitoring, and evidence-based improvement strategies.

Overall, this research provides a conceptual and methodological foundation for translating StC’s operational and feedback data into a continuous improvement pipeline, supporting both strategic decision-making and ethical, explainable use of AI in learning environments.
