## Assessment Task
Deliver a 1,200-word written report (+/- 10%) and a 5- to 7- minute presentation describing and distinguishing the key contributions of cloud computing to business automation.
Please refer to the **Instructions** for details on how to complete this task.

## Context
In the first four weeks, we explored some key concepts in cloud computing such as the advantages of cloud computing over traditional IT infrastructure in business automation, the essential characteristics of the cloud, cloud computing deployment models and service models.

This assessment provides an opportunity for you to apply the knowledge and skills you have learnt in the first four weeks to a close-to real-life scenario. You will have an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of:
- Cloud computing and how the cloud fits with modern computing requirements
- Essential characteristics of cloud computing and the potential of cloud computing, including the benefits and the challenges
- Various types of essential computing elements or services provided by the cloud service providers

## Instructions

### 1. Report
This assessment is based on the following scenario. Read the scenario, then address the following tasks in a 1,200-word report. 

### Scenario
ABC Enterprise launched the ABC app in October 2020, which supports some services such as food delivery, taxi bookings and payments.

ABC ruled out developing an on-premises solution to support its ABC app. ABC is a start-up company and cannot afford the upfront costs of an on-premises infrastructure. Like other start-ups, ABC finds that cloud-based IT has a pay-as-you-grow model, which would allow the company to carefully control
its costs. With cloud technology, IT expenditure would increase only as their business expanded and revenues grew. ABC start searching for cloud services that are highly scalable and reliable because they cannot afford downtime as they are operating in a competitive business where customers can switch to another app if their app has problems.

The company found that only XYZ Cloud provider could meet its needs. The launch of the ABC app was successful with XYZ Cloud, and ABC went on to launch its food delivery service, which offers customers delivery services from 500 restaurants. Data traffic to come from the ABC app is routed via cloud Route
53 to the ABC cloud infrastructure. The data is then processed by elastic computing instances or virtual machines running web and application servers. Cloud storage service is used for backups and imagery.

By using cloud services, ABC reduced the IT start-up costs by 80 percent as the company grew and added more customers. After one campaign, ABC saw that the customer numbers had increased by 10 times in a single month. Despite its increase in customers, ABC has avoided a corresponding increase in IT management expenses.

The Chief Cloud Officer (CCO) is seeking to leverage the best cloud solution to help the business grow. You, as a cloud systems analyst, have now been engaged to provide an initial report to the chief cloud officer addressing several tasks assigned to you.

### Report structure
Based on this scenario, you will need to write a report in which you:
- Provide three benefits of cloud computing over the traditional IT infrastructure of ABC Enterprise. Discuss which cloud characteristics can help to achieve that.
- Discuss any potential challenges ABC Enterprise might face when migrating from traditional infrastructure to the cloud, and how these challenges can be mitigated.
- Discuss the cloud service models and deployment models in detail. Suggest which service model and deployment model are more suitable for this scenario.
- Suggest which cost model is more suitable for this scenario. Provide an in-depth analysis of the recommended cloud cost model.
- If ABC Enterprise decides to choose a cloud service provider other than XYZ, which provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP) would you recommend? Identify at least two essential computing elements from the selected provider that would best address ABC Enterprise's specific requirements to enable industry automations. Rationalise your answer.

Note: You should support your report with a minimum of 10 to 12 references. These should be included using the appropriate APA style. Please refer to the Assessment Rubric for the assessment criteria.

### 2. Presentation
To complete this assessment, you are to create a 5- to 7-minute audio-visual presentation video to describe and distinguish the key contributions of cloud computing to business automation.
- Introduce yourself by your name, Torrens’ student ID and show a student card (if issued) at the beginning of the recording.
- Address the benefits and challenges of cloud computing over the traditional IT infrastructure based on the scenario.
- Discuss the cloud service models and deployment model that is suitable for the case study scenario.

Please refer to the Assessment Rubric for the assessment criteria.

Note: The presentation must be delivered in class to your Learning Facilitator or can be recorded (audio-visual presentation video) and uploaded with the written report.

Refer to the resources at Torrens Academic Skills Webpage for additional guidance on preparing for Oral Presentations. 
Technical support for recording and submitting video assessments with Microsoft Stream is available at Student Hub--Quickstart PDF guides.

### Referencing
