Cloud computing has become embedded in our lives: we use it from the moment we wake up to the time we go to sleep – we’re constantly connected. Emails, social media, streaming, file storage, smart home devices are all examples of cloud computing. This technology is a powerful enabler to our personal lives alone, even more to the business context, which is this report’s focus, as we will dive on ABC Enterprise app case scenario.

ABC app offers delivery services, providing an interesting link between customers-restaurants and has already experience great success on leveraging cloud for expanding the business.
