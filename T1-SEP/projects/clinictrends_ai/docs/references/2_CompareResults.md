# Compare Achieved Results Against External References

Our achieved 80% accuracy on a 30K+ NPS dataset for an aesthetic clinic provides a solid baseline to compare against external references in the health and care industry, with a focus on sentiment analysis and NPS prediction.

- **Vs. E-commerce/Social Media**: The 75-85% accuracy range (e.g., Twitter, Amazon reviews) is closely matched by our 80%, indicating robustness against noisy, text-heavy datasets. Aesthetic clinics’ online reviews (e.g., RealSelf, Google) share this dynamic, suggesting our model handles diverse feedback well.

- **Vs. Customer Support**: The 78-82% accuracy from Zendesk on 10K-50K records aligns with our result. Given aesthetic clinics’ reliance on post-procedure support (e.g., follow-up care), this parity suggests our model captures service-related sentiment effectively, though consultation quality (a clinic-specific factor) may need deeper analysis.

- **Vs. Healthcare NPS**: The 75-80% predictive accuracy for 20K-30K records fits our 80%, while top healthcare NPS scores (e.g., Mayo Clinic at 70) reflect loyalty rather than prediction accuracy. Aesthetic clinics, as boutique providers, may target 50+ NPS (per industry guides), but our 80% accuracy exceeds the predictive benchmark, hinting at potential overperformance if tuned for clinic-specific outcomes (e.g., satisfaction with lip fillers).

- **Vs. 2025 Trends**: Retently’s 2025 healthcare benchmark of +53 (up from 46) indicates improving sentiment, but predictive accuracy benchmarks remain undetailed. Our 80% likely outpaces this trend, though methodological differences (e.g., survey timing, patient demographics) limit direct comparison.

**Critical Analysis**: External references often aggregate data from general healthcare, where clinical outcomes dominate, whereas aesthetic clinics prioritize aesthetic satisfaction, which is subjective and outcome-driven. Our 80% may underrepresent detractors if negative feedback (e.g., poor cosmetic results) is underrepresented in the dataset. Additionally, the lack of clinic-specific benchmarks (e.g., urgent care’s 40-55 vs. boutique’s 70+) suggests our result is promising but context-dependent. As of 10:42 AM AEST, August 08, 2025, no real-time aesthetic clinic benchmarks clarify this gap.

> Notes: These sources offer comparative data (e.g., Kaiser Permanente at 60-70, private practices at 50+), but the focus on general healthcare or urgent care (40-55) may overestimate your 80% accuracy’s context. The aesthetic clinic’s unique pressures (e.g., outcome sensitivity) aren’t addressed, warranting caution in direct comparisons.
