## **Intro (30 sec)**  
Hi, my name is Luis Faria, and this is my SEP401 Assessment 3 presentation. Today I’ll show you a smart solution for analyzing customer feedback using ClinicTrends AI.

## **Problem (30 sec)**  
Clinics collect lots of feedback, but rarely analyze it effectively. Managers need fast insights, analysts need detail—and this project addresses both.

## **Solution Walkthrough (1.5–2 min)**  
This tool lets users upload NPS feedback via CSV, analyzes it using ML, and shows visual dashboards.  
You’ll see sentiment summaries, promoter/detractor trends, and can export reports—all in a few clicks.

## **Tech Stack + Test Highlights (45 sec)**  
Built with Streamlit, Python, scikit-learn, Altair, HuggingFace and BERTopic. We tested the app across multiple scenarios including upload validation, data rendering, and export reliability.

## **Closing (30 sec)**  
ClinicTrends AI helps clinics turn raw feedback into action. Thank you for watching—looking forward to your feedback.
