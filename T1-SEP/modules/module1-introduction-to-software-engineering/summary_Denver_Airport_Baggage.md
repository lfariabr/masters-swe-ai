# Denver Airport Baggage Handling System Case Study

This case study from the International Project Leadership Academy illustrates one of the most expensive software project failures in U.S. history. The automated baggage system at Denver International Airport was plagued with over-engineering, poor planning, and communication breakdowns.

## 🔑 Key Points:

- **Initial Failure**: Original plan did not adequately involve airline input or foresee physical/logistical complications.
- **Timeline Compression**: Pressures to finish before airport opening caused risky compromises.
- **Technology Overreach**: A complex, centralized system was used instead of phased manual + automated mix.
- **Lack of Testing**: Full system integration was not tested until very late.
- **Final Result**: System abandoned after $200M+ in sunk costs.

## 🔍 Relevance to ClinicTrendsAI:

Building a predictive model with automated insights may seem simple on paper, but without staged rollouts and pilot testing, implementation could suffer. A lesson here is to deliver an MVP to a single clinic first, validate predictions and UI flow, then scale.

## 🔁 Overall Insights:

These readings reinforce the core principle that software success is less about coding and more about planning, communication, and iteration.

For ClinicTrendsAI:
- Start small and evolve (Agile mindset)
- Validate assumptions early through MVPs
- Document stakeholder expectations
- Build a system that’s not just intelligent—but also reliable, testable, and maintainable
