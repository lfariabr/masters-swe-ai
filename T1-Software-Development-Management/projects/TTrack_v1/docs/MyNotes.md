# 🧠 TTrack – Torrens Degree Tracker

TTrack is a desktop application designed to help students and academic staff **track academic progress** by comparing a student’s **official transcript** with their **prescribed curriculum**. It automates the validation of completed, missing, and elective subjects, offering a clean interface and clear dashboard outputs.
