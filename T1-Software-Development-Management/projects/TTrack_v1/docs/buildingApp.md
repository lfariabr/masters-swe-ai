### ðŸ”§ Building the Application

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ (3.10.x recommended for best compatibility)
- pip (latest version)
- PyInstaller (`pip install pyinstaller`)
- Required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Building on macOS
```bash
# First time only: Make the build script executable x
chmod +x build_mac.sh

# Install dependencies and build the app
pip install -r requirements.txt
./build_mac.sh

# Copy .env to the app bundle and open it
cp .env "dist/TTrack.app/Contents/MacOS/.env"
open dist/TTrack.app
```

#### Building on Windows
```cmd
# Install dependencies if not already installed
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the build script
build.bat

# The executable will be available in the 'dist' folder
# Run it by double-clicking dist\TTrack.exe
copy .env dist\.env
dist\TTrack.exe
```

#### Distribution
- The built application is self-contained and can be distributed as-is
- Each OS requires its own build process:
  - macOS: Creates `TTrack.app` in the `dist` folder
  - Windows: Creates `TTrack.exe` in the `dist` folder
- **Note**: You cannot build for Windows from macOS or vice versa. Each platform build must be performed on the respective operating system.
- For Windows, the application is built as `TTrack.exe`

#### QA macBook behavior:
1 - A random terminal window pop ups with the following writings:
Last login: Sat Jul  5 10:28:42 on ttys004
/Users/luisfaria/.zprofile:3: command not found: pyenv
/Users/luisfaria/Desktop/sEngineer/masters_SWEAI/T1-Software-Development-Management/projects/TTrack_v1/dist/TTrack ; exit;
> /Users/luisfaria/Desktop/sEngineer/masters_SWEAI/T1-Software-Development-Management/projects/TTrack_v1/dist/TTrack ; exit;
qt.svg: Cannot open file '/Users/luisfaria/public/ttrack_app_icon.svg', because: No such file or directory
qt.svg: Cannot open file '/Users/luisfaria/public/ttrack_app_icon.svg', because: No such file or directory
2 - TTrack app opens but logo from /public/ttrack_app_icon.svg is not displayed
3 - When I click on buttons Try with Sample Data or Download the Template, app suddenly crashes
4 - If I try to upload files and process data, it happens as expected, data is processed and Results page appear with correctly expected information.

FIX:
1 - Created TTrack-macOs.spec file to use exclusively on build_mac.sh
2 - Added data directory to TTrack-macOs.spec file
3 - Rolled back tab_input to previous version and tested building again
4 - Works fine

#### QA Windows behavior:
1 - The application runs perfectly when I download from the upload artifact part:
Run actions/upload-artifact@v4
With the provided path, there will be 1 file uploaded
Artifact name is valid!
Root directory input is valid!

2 - I noticed, however, that the logo, which should be retrieved from public folder is not being loaded

FIX:
1 - Added `resource_path` at `main.py` to deal with PyInstaller bundle
