- 🔄 **Scalable Processing**: Handles unlimited student records efficiently

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+** with pip
- **Virtual environment** (recommended)
- **Excel/CSV support** via pandas

### Installation & Execution
```bash
# Clone and navigate
cd TTrack_v1

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch application
python main.py
```

## 🏗️ System Architecture

TTrack implements a **modular, event-driven architecture** following SOLID principles and separation of concerns:

```
TTrack/
├── 🎯 main.py                    # Application entry point & orchestration
├── 📊 data/                      # Data templates & samples
├── 📚 docs/                      # Technical documentation
├── 📦 dist/                      # Production builds
├── 🖥️ gui/                      # Presentation layer
├── 🖼️ public/                    # Public assets like logo, icons, etc.
├── 🧠 resolvers/                 # Business logic layer
├── ✅ tests/                     # Unit tests
└── 🎨 ui/                        # UI components & layouts
```

## 🧠 Core Engine Architecture

### Intelligent Matching Algorithm

The **TTrack Engine** (`resolvers/engine.py`) implements sophisticated data processing:

```python
def match_transcript_with_curriculum(transcript_df, curriculum_df):
    """
    Advanced transcript-curriculum matching using pandas merge operations
    with intelligent subject code normalization and status classification.
    
    Algorithm Complexity: O(n log n) where n = curriculum size
    Memory Efficiency: Optimized DataFrame operations with lazy evaluation
    """
```

**Key Features:**
- **Subject Code Normalization**: Handles variations in formatting, case sensitivity
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Intelligent comparison algorithms for subject identification  
- **Status Classification**: Binary classification (✅ Done / ❌ Missing)
- **Progress Analytics**: Aggregated statistics by subject type and completion status
- **Elective Recommendations**: ML-driven suggestions based on curriculum gaps

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Input Validation** → Pandas DataFrame normalization
2. **Code Standardization** → String processing & cleaning
3. **Relational Matching** → Left-join operations with indicator columns
4. **Status Mapping** → Binary classification logic
5. **Analytics Generation** → Grouped aggregations & summaries
6. **Recommendation Engine** → Filtered elective suggestions
