# üìÑ Summary of "When Professional Standards Are Lax: The CONFIRM Failure and Its Lessons"

## üìö Overview

This case study examines the failure of the CONFIRM project‚Äîa joint venture initiated in 1988 by Hilton Hotels Corporation, Marriott Corporation, and Budget Rent-A-Car Corporation, subcontracted to AMR Information Services, Inc. (AMRIS), a subsidiary of American Airlines. The project's goal was to develop a state-of-the-art reservation system integrating hotel, airline, and car rental services. Despite significant investments, the project was canceled after several years, highlighting critical lessons in professional standards and ethics within information systems (IS) development.
