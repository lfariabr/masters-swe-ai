# Chapter 3 – Scrum Overview  
**From**: *The Project Manager’s Guide to Mastering Agile* by Charles G. Cobb (2015)

## 🌀 What is Scrum?
Scrum is an **empirical process framework** designed to handle complexity and uncertainty. It emphasizes frequent inspection and adaptation, making it well-suited for software development and other unpredictable environments.

---

## 🔍 Empirical vs. Defined Process Models
- **Empirical**: Learn and adapt by doing (suitable for complex, changing requirements)
- **Defined**: Plan everything up front (works when all is known)

---

## 🧩 Scrum Roles
1. **Product Owner**
   - Manages the product backlog
   - Prioritizes items for business value
   - Acts as decision-maker on what gets built

2. **Scrum Master**
   - Facilitates the Scrum process
   - Acts as servant-leader and agile coach
   - Removes blockers, ensures team understanding

3. **Development Team**
   - Cross-functional, self-organizing
   - Delivers “done” increments each sprint
   - No sub-teams or titles

---

## 🧪 Scrum Ceremonies
- **Sprint Planning**: Decide what to do in the sprint
- **Daily Standup**: Sync up and identify blockers
- **Sprint Review**: Demo and collect feedback
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflect and improve

---

## 📦 Artifacts
- **Product Backlog**: Prioritized list of work
- **Sprint Backlog**: What will be done in the sprint
- **Increment**: Shippable product output

---

## 🔁 General Scrum Principles
- Embrace **uncertainty and variability**
- Rely on **incremental development**
- Favor **validated learning**
- Use **short feedback loops**
- Focus on **working solutions over documentation**

---

## ❤️ Scrum Values
1. **Commitment**
2. **Focus**
3. **Openness**
4. **Respect**
5. **Courage**

> These values support collaboration, cross-functionality, and continuous improvement.

## ✅ Summary
Scrum is more than a methodology—it’s a **mindset shift** from control to collaboration, from documentation to working code. The chapter outlines both **practical elements** (roles, events, artifacts) and **core principles/values** that make Scrum adaptable, efficient, and effective in managing complex projects.
