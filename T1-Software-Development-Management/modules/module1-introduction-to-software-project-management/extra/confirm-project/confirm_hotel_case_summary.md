**Timeframe**: Early 1990s  
**Stakeholders**: Marriott, Hilton, American Express, Andersen Consulting  
**Goal**: Build a next-generation, centralized hotel and travel reservation platform

## 📖 Overview

The **CONFIRM Project** was launched by major hospitality players like **Marriott** and **Hilton**, alongside **American Express** and **Andersen Consulting** (now Accenture). Its goal was to create a **global, all-in-one travel reservation system** that could handle hotel bookings, rental cars, loyalty programs, and payment systems.

It was envisioned as a **one-stop platform** to rival global distribution systems (GDS) like Sabre and transform the travel industry. Despite bold ambitions, the project failed completely before any public release.

## 🔍 What Went Wrong

### 1. Stakeholder Misalignment
- Hilton and Marriott had **conflicting visions**: one prioritized loyalty programs, the other customer ownership.
- American Express had its own goals around **payment and travel bundling**.

### 2. Vendor Overreach
- Andersen Consulting had too much control over architecture and delivery.
- Lack of internal technical ownership from the client side.

### 3. Scope Explosion
- Tried to solve too many problems: booking, pricing, CRM, billing, inventory sync—all at once.
- No incremental MVP approach—everything was waterfall and monolithic.

### 4. Technology Overreach
- Wanted real-time inventory and booking across global hotel chains.
- Attempted complex integrations in an era without stable APIs or cloud infrastructure.

## 💀 The Collapse

- Spent over **$125 million USD** with no usable product.
- Stakeholders pulled out one by one as costs rose and deadlines slipped.
- Andersen rebranded remnants as **"Envision"**, but that too failed.

## 📚 Lessons for SDM & Engineering

- **Alignment before execution**: Shared vision is more important than shared funding.
- **Vendor accountability matters**: Never let a consulting firm drive both the business and tech strategy.
- **Start small and iterate**: MVPs beat moonshots when complexity is high.
- **Build for readiness**: Ambition must match technological maturity.

## 🤹 Curiosities

- At its peak, Andersen was billing **over $1 million per month**.
- Called the **“Manhattan Project of the travel industry”** by insiders.
- Failed before Expedia, Booking.com, or modern APIs even existed.
