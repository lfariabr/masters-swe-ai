# 💸 Summary of the Queensland Health Payroll System Failure – Case Study

## 📚 Overview

The **Queensland Health Payroll System** is one of Australia's most infamous IT project failures. What was meant to be a **$6.19 million payroll replacement** for 80,000+ healthcare workers ballooned into a **$1.2 billion disaster**. Implemented by **IBM** and overseen by the **Queensland Government**, the system launched in 2010 and became a cautionary tale in **poor governance, scope mismanagement, and vendor oversight**.

---

## 🧱 What Was the Project?

- Replace the aging **LATTICE payroll system** for Queensland Health.
- Required to support **award-based pay rules**, shift differentials, and varying work types.
- IBM won the contract, proposing **SAP** as the technical platform, with **WorkBrain** for timekeeping.

---

## ❌ What Went Wrong?

### 🔍 1. Incomplete Requirements
- The system needed to accommodate **24,000+ pay rules**, but IBM began work with only a **draft specification**.
- The **full scope was never fully documented** or agreed upon.

### 🧯 2. Rushed Implementation
- Despite warnings and incomplete testing, the system was **launched in March 2010** under political pressure.
- Payroll staff were overwhelmed and under-trained for the new system.

### 💣 3. Catastrophic Impact
- Thousands of staff were **underpaid, overpaid, or not paid at all**.
- Manual workarounds and “payroll remediation” ran for **years after go-live**.

### 🤐 4. Governance Failures
- Oversight was weak, and the project lacked **independent assurance**.
- IBM’s fixed-price contract was **renegotiated downward**, removing critical testing responsibilities.

---

## 💸 Consequences

- Final cost: **AUD $1.2 billion**, including ongoing remediation.
- The system became **operational**, but only after extensive fixes and permanent workarounds.
- A Commission of Inquiry in 2013 **heavily criticized IBM and Queensland Government practices**.
- The scandal had **political fallout**, including resignations and public backlash.

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

### ✅ 1. Don’t Launch Unfinished Systems
- A go-live decision must be based on **functional readiness**, not **political deadlines**.

### ✅ 2. Document and Validate Requirements
- A complex system without a fully documented scope is **doomed to fail**.

### ✅ 3. Contracts Must Be Balanced and Clear
- Risk transfer to vendors only works with **enforceable accountability**.

### ✅ 4. Test Thoroughly — Especially in Payroll
- Payroll systems affect **people’s lives and trust**. Rigorous **end-to-end testing** is non-negotiable.
