# Deep Summary of Key Readings for SDM404 – Project Management and Agile Development

---

## 1. Cobb, Charles G. (2015). _The Project Manager’s Guide to Mastering Agile_ – Chapter 1: Introduction to Agile Project Management

**Context & Purpose:**  
This chapter offers a foundational view of how Agile methods revolutionized project management, particularly in the software industry. It serves as both a historical overview and a strategic guide for project managers transitioning from traditional models to Agile.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **From Waterfall to Agile:** Cobb highlights the rigidity and inefficiency of the Waterfall model, especially when dealing with fast-changing requirements. Agile arose as a response to these limitations, offering a more flexible, customer-focused model.
- **Changing Role of the Project Manager:** In Agile, the PM’s role shifts from command-and-control to a **facilitator and servant leader**, empowering teams instead of directing them.
- **Agile Values vs. Traditional Mindset:** Agile prioritizes "responding to change" over "following a fixed plan," encouraging collaboration, quick iterations, and constant feedback.
- **Business Agility:** Agile isn’t just a methodology—it’s a cultural shift toward **adaptive business strategy**, where even enterprise governance must evolve to support team-level agility.

**Application for SDM404 Projects:**
- Aligns well with trimester-based sprints.
- Highlights the importance of adaptive planning and ongoing stakeholder feedback.
- Encourages student teams to prioritize value delivery, not just task completion.

## 2. Taylor, James (2004). _Managing Information Technology Projects_ – Chapter 3: Information Technology Project and Systems Life Cycles

**Context & Purpose:**  
This chapter builds a bridge between **project management lifecycles** (PLC) and **system development lifecycles** (SDLC), especially within the IT industry. It provides a structured approach to understand how IT projects differ from other domains.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Distinct but Intertwined Lifecycles:** The PLC covers phases like initiation, planning, execution, and closure, while the SDLC includes feasibility, analysis, design, implementation, and support.
- **Team Dynamics:** The chapter emphasizes the evolution of **team activities and roles** at each stage, noting how coordination between business users, analysts, and developers is essential.
- **Risk Management and Control Gates:** Suggests embedding **review points** (control gates) to assess scope, budget, and timeline integrity throughout the lifecycle.
- **Unique Nature of IT Projects:** Unlike construction or manufacturing, IT projects are more vulnerable to **scope creep, tech constraints, and changing requirements.**

**Application for SDM404 Projects:**
- Encourages alignment between project timelines and technical development phases.
- Suggests how to model both "product" and "project" simultaneously.
- Useful for structuring deliverables like architecture diagrams, technical documentation, and sprint reviews.

## 3. Lewis, James P. (2007). _Fundamentals of Project Management_ – Chapter 1: An Overview of Project Management

**Context & Purpose:**  
Lewis introduces project management principles by defining what constitutes a project and how managing constraints is the core challenge of any project manager.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **What is a Project?** A project is a temporary endeavor with a unique outcome. It differs from routine operations by its finite scope and lifespan.
- **Triple Constraint Triangle:** The classic PM triad—**scope, time, and cost**—is introduced here. Change in one constraint affects the others.
- **Planning is Not Optional:** Lewis advocates for **front-loading effort in planning**, as it reduces downstream risk.
- **PM Responsibilities:** Includes managing teams, resources, and stakeholders. Communication is a recurring emphasis.

**Application for SDM404 Projects:**
- Provides a structured mindset for defining scope and evaluating trade-offs.
- Ideal for student teams new to PM—offers a clean breakdown of key responsibilities.
- Emphasizes **communication and planning** as the backbone of successful team-based work.

## 4. Glass, Robert L. (1997). _Software Runaways: Some Surprising Findings_

**Context & Purpose:**  
Glass analyzes several failed large-scale software projects, identifying common causes and dispelling popular myths around project failure. This is an essential read for understanding **why projects go wrong**.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Not Just Management Failure:** While management flaws are present, technical decisions (e.g., choosing immature technology) also play a critical role.
- **Complexity and Ambition:** Many failed projects aimed too high too fast—overpromising innovation, automation, or integration.
- **Case Studies:** Includes well-documented disasters like the Denver Airport Baggage System, providing real-world cautionary tales.
- **KPMG Survey Insight:** Among 100+ projects surveyed, **unclear objectives and poor planning** were the top contributors to failure.

**Application for SDM404 Projects:**
- Encourages scope control and realistic expectations.
- Reinforces the value of incremental delivery and clear communication.
- Great for risk assessment templates—helps teams anticipate where things might break.

## Final Note
Together, these four readings give you a 360º view of project management:
- Cobb introduces **modern agility**.
- Taylor connects **project flow with technical systems**.
- Lewis outlines **universal PM principles**.
- Glass warns against **hubris and poor planning**.

Perfect foundation for any SDM404 student project or capstone work.
