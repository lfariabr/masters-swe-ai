# 📉 Summary of the CONFIRM Project Failure – Case Study

## 📚 Overview

The **CONFIRM project** was a high-profile joint venture launched in 1988 by **Hilton Hotels**, **Marriott Corporation**, and **Budget Rent-a-Car**, intended to develop a revolutionary **global reservation system** for hotels, airlines, and car rentals. Subcontracted to **AMR Information Services (AMRIS)**, the IT arm of American Airlines, the project was ultimately **canceled after years of work and millions of dollars**, making it one of the most notable case studies in **IS project failure**.

## 🧱 What Was CONFIRM?

- A proposed **state-of-the-art reservation system** combining hotel, flight, and rental bookings.
- Intended to be a **multi-industry platform** leveraging **SABRE** (AMR’s airline reservation system).
- Managed under a new joint venture entity called **Intrico**.
- The project had major backers, high stakes, and ambitious technical goals.

## ❌ Why Did It Fail?

### 🔍 1. Vague and Evolving Requirements
- Stakeholders had **different expectations** and the scope kept changing.
- There was **no shared vision** or fixed project specification baseline.

### 📵 2. Poor Communication
- Insufficient communication between AMRIS developers and client stakeholders.
- Lack of transparency about progress and risks led to **mismatched perceptions**.

### 💻 3. Technical Overreach
- The system aimed for **extreme complexity** without proven infrastructure.
- Performance, scalability, and integration challenges were underestimated.

### 🤐 4. Ethical and Professional Failures
- AMRIS **withheld information** about delays and technical risks.
- Clients were led to believe progress was on track when it wasn’t.
- This resulted in wasted investment and damaged reputations.

---

## 💣 Consequences

- Millions of dollars were lost in development and planning.
- All initial stakeholder companies **pulled out**.
- **No usable system** was ever delivered.
- The CONFIRM case became a **benchmark failure in IS education**.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

### ✅ 1. Clear Requirements and Stakeholder Alignment
- Projects of this magnitude need **precise and evolving documentation** and stakeholder buy-in.

### ✅ 2. Transparency and Ethical Communication
- Hiding risks or misleading stakeholders is **professionally unethical and dangerous**.

### ✅ 3. Technical Feasibility Matters
- Ambition must be balanced by **realistic goals** and staged implementation.

### ✅ 4. Independent Oversight
- A neutral third party or external auditor could have mitigated internal bias and denial.
