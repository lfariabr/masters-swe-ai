# ðŸ“˜ Synthesis of Core Project Management Readings for SDM404

---

## 1. **The Project Managerâ€™s Guide to Mastering Agile**  
ðŸ“– *Charles G. Cobb (2015)*

- **Purpose**: Introduces Agile principles and their impact on project management.
- **Key Ideas**:
  - Agile arose as a response to the rigidity of Waterfall.
  - The project manager becomes a *servant leader*, not a taskmaster.
  - Emphasizes *iteration, feedback, and adaptation* over rigid plans.
  - Agile extends beyond engineeringâ€”it promotes *business agility* at every level.
- **Relevance to SDM404**:
  - Encourages adaptive planning in trimester-based team projects.
  - Promotes *customer-centric thinking* and value-driven delivery.

## 2. **Software Runaways: Some Surprising Findings**  
ðŸ“– *Robert L. Glass (1997)*

- **Purpose**: Dissects high-profile project failures to uncover real causes.
- **Key Ideas**:
  - Failures stem not just from poor management but also *bad technical choices*.
  - Overambitious goals and unrealistic timelines are common culprits.
  - Unclear requirements and weak planning sink projects more than anything.
  - Famous failures like the Denver Airport Baggage System are used as examples.
- **Relevance to SDM404**:
  - Reinforces the need for *realistic scope*, *clear communication*, and *risk analysis*.
  - Excellent foundation for *retrospectives* and *risk mitigation plans*.

## 3. **Managing Information Technology Projects**  
ðŸ“– *James Taylor (2004), Chapter 3*

- **Purpose**: Clarifies the dual lifecycles in IT projectsâ€”Project vs. Systems.
- **Key Ideas**:
  - Project Lifecycle (PLC) = initiation â†’ planning â†’ execution â†’ closure.
  - Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC) = feasibility â†’ design â†’ development â†’ maintenance.
  - IT projects need *control gates* for periodic assessment and decision-making.
  - Emphasizes the collaboration between *business*, *analysts*, and *developers*.
- **Relevance to SDM404**:
  - Offers a dual-track framework for managing both the *team process* and the *technical system*.
  - Helps structure deliverables like system diagrams, sprint logs, and architecture docs.

## 4. **Fundamentals of Project Management**  
ðŸ“– *James P. Lewis (2007), Chapter 1*

- **Purpose**: A clean, practical introduction to the basics of project management.
- **Key Ideas**:
  - A project is a *temporary, goal-oriented* endeavor.
  - The **Triple Constraint** (Scope, Time, Cost) governs all project decisions.
  - Planning reduces riskâ€”itâ€™s a proactive shield, not a bureaucratic burden.
  - Project managers are *communicators*, *coordinators*, and *leaders*.
- **Relevance to SDM404**:
  - Ideal for team formation and kickoff phase.
  - Reinforces the need to *define objectives*, *assign roles*, and *balance constraints* early on.
