## 4. Glass, Robert L. (1997). _Software Runaways: Some Surprising Findings_

**Context & Purpose:**  
Glass analyzes several failed large-scale software projects, identifying common causes and dispelling popular myths around project failure. This is an essential read for understanding **why projects go wrong**.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Not Just Management Failure:** While management flaws are present, technical decisions (e.g., choosing immature technology) also play a critical role.
- **Complexity and Ambition:** Many failed projects aimed too high too fast—overpromising innovation, automation, or integration.
- **Case Studies:** Includes well-documented disasters like the Denver Airport Baggage System, providing real-world cautionary tales.
- **KPMG Survey Insight:** Among 100+ projects surveyed, **unclear objectives and poor planning** were the top contributors to failure.

**Application for SDM404 Projects:**
- Encourages scope control and realistic expectations.
- Reinforces the value of incremental delivery and clear communication.
- Great for risk assessment templates—helps teams anticipate where things might break.
