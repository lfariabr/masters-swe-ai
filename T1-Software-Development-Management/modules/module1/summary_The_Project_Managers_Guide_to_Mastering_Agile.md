## 1. Cobb, Charles G. (2015). _The Project Manager’s Guide to Mastering Agile_ – Chapter 1: Introduction to Agile Project Management

**Context & Purpose:**  
This chapter offers a foundational view of how Agile methods revolutionized project management, particularly in the software industry. It serves as both a historical overview and a strategic guide for project managers transitioning from traditional models to Agile.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **From Waterfall to Agile:** Cobb highlights the rigidity and inefficiency of the Waterfall model, especially when dealing with fast-changing requirements. Agile arose as a response to these limitations, offering a more flexible, customer-focused model.
- **Changing Role of the Project Manager:** In Agile, the PM’s role shifts from command-and-control to a **facilitator and servant leader**, empowering teams instead of directing them.
- **Agile Values vs. Traditional Mindset:** Agile prioritizes "responding to change" over "following a fixed plan," encouraging collaboration, quick iterations, and constant feedback.
- **Business Agility:** Agile isn’t just a methodology—it’s a cultural shift toward **adaptive business strategy**, where even enterprise governance must evolve to support team-level agility.

**Application for SDM404 Projects:**
- Aligns well with trimester-based sprints.
- Highlights the importance of adaptive planning and ongoing stakeholder feedback.
- Encourages student teams to prioritize value delivery, not just task completion.
