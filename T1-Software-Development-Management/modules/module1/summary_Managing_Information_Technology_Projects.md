## 2. Taylor, James (2004). _Managing Information Technology Projects_ â€“ Chapter 3: Information Technology Project and Systems Life Cycles

**Context & Purpose:**  
This chapter builds a bridge between **project management lifecycles** (PLC) and **system development lifecycles** (SDLC), especially within the IT industry. It provides a structured approach to understand how IT projects differ from other domains.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Distinct but Intertwined Lifecycles:** The PLC covers phases like initiation, planning, execution, and closure, while the SDLC includes feasibility, analysis, design, implementation, and support.
- **Team Dynamics:** The chapter emphasizes the evolution of **team activities and roles** at each stage, noting how coordination between business users, analysts, and developers is essential.
- **Risk Management and Control Gates:** Suggests embedding **review points** (control gates) to assess scope, budget, and timeline integrity throughout the lifecycle.
- **Unique Nature of IT Projects:** Unlike construction or manufacturing, IT projects are more vulnerable to **scope creep, tech constraints, and changing requirements.**

**Application for SDM404 Projects:**
- Encourages alignment between project timelines and technical development phases.
- Suggests how to model both "product" and "project" simultaneously.
- Useful for structuring deliverables like architecture diagrams, technical documentation, and sprint reviews.
