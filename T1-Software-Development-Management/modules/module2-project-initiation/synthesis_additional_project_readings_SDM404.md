- **Key Ideas:**  
  - Agile emerged in response to the limitations of Waterfall and heavyweight documentation.
  - Influenced by lean manufacturing, iterative models, and collaboration-driven values.
  - Core values prioritize:
    - People over processes  
    - Working solutions over excessive specs  
    - Collaboration over contract  
    - Adaptation over strict plans
  - Agile principles promote continuous delivery, empowered teams, and self-reflection.

- **Relevance to SDM404:**

## 2. *Project Management JumpStart*  
ðŸ“– Kim Heldman (2011) â€“ Chapter 3: *Initiating the Project*

- **Purpose:**  
  Provides a structured overview of how to properly start a project, from concept to charter.

- **Key Ideas:**  
  - The **Initiating phase** defines project worth, secures approvals, and appoints a project manager.  
  - Triggers for projects include: business needs, legal requirements, technology shifts, and more.  
  - **Project concept documents** help filter viable projects before drafting a charter.  
  - Selection methods include payback period, ROI, IRR, and scoring models.  
  - A well-structured **project charter** sets the foundation: it defines goals, roles, budget, and grants authority.

- **Relevance to SDM404:**  
  - Clarifies the tools students can use to scope and justify team project work.  
  - Reinforces stakeholder mapping and the importance of early buy-in via kick-off meetings.  
  - Aligns with assignment tasks like drafting charters, estimating scope, and defining feasibility.
