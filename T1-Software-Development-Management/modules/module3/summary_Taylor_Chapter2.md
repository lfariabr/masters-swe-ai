# Chapter 2 ‚Äì Foundations of Project Management  
**From**: *Managing Information Technology Projects* by James Taylor (2004)

## üìå Overview
This chapter introduces the **foundational tools** and terminology used in project management, especially for managing IT initiatives. It discusses the shift from simple tools to complex techniques due to technological advancement and complexity.

## üîß Four Key Project Management Tools
1. **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**  
   - Most critical planning tool
   - Decomposes project into manageable components
   - Basis for planning, scheduling, budgeting, and controlling
   - Two formats: **Indented** and **Graphical**
   - Example hierarchy: Project > Subsystem > Task > Subtask > Work Package

2. **Network Analysis (PDM ‚Äì Precedence Diagram Method)**  
   - Determines task interdependencies
   - Helps estimate early/late start and finish times
   - Identifies **critical path** and slack time

3. **Gantt Chart**  
   - Bar chart showing task durations across a timeline
   - Visually communicates planned vs. actual progress
   - Easily understood by stakeholders

4. **Earned Value Analysis (EVA)**  
   - Tracks both cost and schedule performance
   - Key terms:
     - **PV (Planned Value)**  
     - **EV (Earned Value)**  
     - **AC (Actual Cost)**  
     - **CPI = EV / AC**  
     - **SPI = EV / PV**

## üß† Other Key Insights
- Project Management is both **Art** (people management) and **Science** (tools and techniques)
- Emphasis on **customer-defined performance criteria**
- WBS is the **cornerstone**‚Äî‚ÄúIf it's not in the WBS, it's not in the project‚Äù
- Importance of estimating tasks using historical data + contingencies
- Use of SPI and CPI in forecasting costs and durations

## ‚úÖ Summary
The chapter positions WBS as the foundation of all other tools. With WBS, one can derive schedules (via PDM), visualize them (via Gantt), and track them (via EVA). The goal is to **plan and deliver IT projects effectively**, within time and budget constraints, and aligned with stakeholder expectations.
