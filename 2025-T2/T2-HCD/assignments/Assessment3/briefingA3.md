## Assessment 3
### Assessment Brief 3: **System Solution**

Assessment: System Solution - Report and Presentation
Length: 3,500 words
Due Date: 03/12/2025

#### Summary: 
Working in small groups, you are required to develop and submit two components for this assessment. There will be a Part A and Part B.

Part A: is a 3500-word report. Working in a group, you will select one person’s solution from Assessment 2, and you will work together to develop and elaborate on the system solution they identified in Assessment 2. You may only select one group member’s Assessment 2 solution.

Part B: will be an 8-14 minute presentation. Your presentation should highlight to the class (and the facilitator) the details of your system solution as detailed in your 3500 word report, and how well it deals with the issue identified in Assessment 2.

As a group, you are required to present and write the report. This means, each member of the group will present on one component of the System Solution, as well as write the relevant section of the report.

#### Context
As part of Assessment 2, you proposed a system solution. This solution should have addressed issues with an existing technology. As technology moves and changes, a next step is required - a full development of this solution. 

Regularly, changes to systems must have supporting evidence, to make sure that the changes are achieving their desired goal. Many companies require extensive vetting of changes before they adjust important services or structures.

Assessment 3 will evaluate your understanding of the scale of change required for the system that you have analysed in Assessment 2. Your explanation of the core issue(s), their fundamental causes, and the steps you take to stop, as well as prevent further issues, are the areas you will be assessed on. Furthermore, you will be assessed on your written and presentation skills.

This assessment helps to prepare you for undertaking similar projects in industry, where you must be able to analyse real issues in existing systems, and make recommendations based on your own original solutions to these identified issues. Developing solutions to these issues is of paramount importance, and can make the difference between success and catastrophic failure of an existing system.

#### Instructions
You will need to form groups to complete this assessment. Once you have formed a group (ideally 3-4 people depending on the size of the class) you should discuss which of your assessments (from Assessment 2) you will develop further for Assessment 3. Once you have come to a decision as a group, you will need to complete the following two components:

- Part A: A 3500 word report with equal contributions from the whole group.
- Part B: An 8-14 minute presentation that highlights to the class (and the facilitator) the details of your system solution, and how well it deals with the issue identified in Assessment 2. Again, you must all contribute to the presentation.

##### Part A: Report
The report should adhere to the following five-part structure:

1. Introduction / context:
This section of the report provides context for the issue. This should be no longer than one paragraph, and is only required for context of the issue under discussion.

2. Comprehensive issue breakdown:
As with the previous assessment, the issues from the technology discussed need to be highlighted. Ensure you clearly define the issues you are solving, and give reasons as to why you are not solving other potential issues.

3. System Solution proposal:
This section of the report should comprise the bulk of your writing. Here, a system is proposed, and it may differ based on the skillset within your team. Include images, technical diagrams, or code snippet examples as appropriate, to ensure you communicate your solution’s effectiveness appropriately.

4. Effectiveness prediction:
This section should be placed between the solution and the conclusion, and predict the effectiveness of your solution, based on previous examples implemented by other industry entities to solve similar problems. This should back up your previous justifications made during the report.

5. Conclusion:
This section should conclude your report.

##### Part B: Presentation
The 8-14 minute presentation should sum up the contents of your report, and provide any additional context or meaning that makes understanding the contents of the report easier. There should not be any material exclusive to either section - the report or the presentation.

##### Referencing
Referencing is essential for this assignment. A minimum of 10-12 references is required for this, including at least eight academic sources.

(An academic source is one that has been peer-reviewed, or cited in the past)

Your references are examined in relevance to ensure that your arguments and justifications are based on sound reasoning and clear relevance.

Ensure that you reference according to the appropriate APA style, for citing and referencing information, as well as all appropriate research sources.

It is essential that you use appropriate APA style for citing and referencing research. Please see more information on referencing here: http://library.laureate.net.au/research_skills/referencing
