## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Track Progress**: Use the checkboxes in the README
2. **Learn by Doing**: Don't skip the "why" - understand each technology
3. **Document Everything**: Future you (and dev.to readers) will thank you
4. **Start Simple**: Phase 0 is intentionally basic - master it before moving on
5. **Build in Public**: Share your journey on Twitter/LinkedIn/dev.to
