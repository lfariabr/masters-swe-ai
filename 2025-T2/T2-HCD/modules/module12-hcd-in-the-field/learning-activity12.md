# Learning Exercise: HCD Evaluation

Select a website / service from the below list, and develop a one-page report on how one attribute of that website adheres to the HCD principles we have covered in previous modules. For example:

- How their User Experience is designed (module 3.)
- How they follow particular trends (module 4.)
- How they design for a global context (module 9.)
- How the system may have been redesigned in the past (research the website’s previous iterations before discussing this, module 10.)

You may select from the following websites:
- Youtube
- Linkedin
- Wikipedia
- OneDrive
- Google Maps.
Consider each of the principles that we have discussed during each of the modules. Areas to focus on include:

- Usability: How usable is the service? Is there ever a tutorial when accessing the website?
- Prior context: How much previous experience is a user required to have. Could a first time internet user access this service?
- How does this compare to analog versions of this service (if any) and how usable is this service versus those services?
- How successful is this service? Is it the main service or are there better competitors (use web site rankings for these statistics)
- Do the usage statistics reflect usability? Are more popular competitors more usable?

Once you have created your one-page report, upload it to the module forum, and comment on at least one other student’s set of examples.

Hi everyone, the service that I've decided to evaluate is YouTube. 

For this evaluation, I will analyze how YouTube's user experience design adheres to HCD principles, particularly focusing on usability and prior context considerations.

### Usability Analysis

YouTube demonstrates strong usability through its intuitive navigation, clear content organization, and minimal learning curve for new users. The platform provides contextual help and tooltips, and the interface remains consistent across devices. The autoplay, big cards with thumbs and short descriptions makes it engaging for the user to engage with content effortlessly, just comfortably scrolling through recommendations.

### Prior Context Analysis

YouTube requires minimal prior context for new users to begin watching content immediately. The platform's design is very intuitive, with clear visual cues and familiar interface elements that don't require extensive prior knowledge or training to use effectively. New users can start watching videos right away without needing to understand complex features or settings.

### Analog Comparison

Compared to traditional television, YouTube offers a more accessible and on-demand experience. While TV requires scheduled viewing and limited channel selection, YouTube allows users to watch content anytime, anywhere, with personalized recommendations based on viewing history. This shift from linear to on-demand consumption represents a significant improvement in user control and convenience.

### How successful is YouTube?

YouTube has been highly successful, becoming the dominant video-sharing platform globally. Its success can be attributed to its user-friendly interface, vast content library, and effective recommendation algorithms that keep users engaged. 
YT's ability to adapt to user preferences and provide personalized content has made it a go-to source for entertainment, education, and information, outperforming many competitors in terms of user engagement and market share.
Also worth mentioning the youtube shorts, a clear response to the rise of short-form video content and competition from TikTok and Instagram.

### Usage stats

According to Statista(1), as of 2024, YouTube has over 2.7 billion monthly active users worldwide, making it one of the most visited websites globally. The platform's usage statistics clearly reflect its high usability, as evidenced by its massive user base and high engagement rates. 
The success of YouTube can be attributed to its intuitive interface, personalized recommendations, and the ability to easily discover and consume content tailored to individual preferences.
