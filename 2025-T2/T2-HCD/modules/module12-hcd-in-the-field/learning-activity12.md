# Learning Exercise: HCD Evaluation

Select a website / service from the below list, and develop a one-page report on how one attribute of that website adheres to the HCD principles we have covered in previous modules. For example:

- How their User Experience is designed (module 3.)
- How they follow particular trends (module 4.)
- How they design for a global context (module 9.)
- How the system may have been redesigned in the past (research the website’s previous iterations before discussing this, module 10.)

You may select from the following websites:
- Youtube
- Linkedin
- Wikipedia
- OneDrive
- Google Maps.
Consider each of the principles that we have discussed during each of the modules. Areas to focus on include:

- Usability: How usable is the service? Is there ever a tutorial when accessing the website?
- Prior context: How much previous experience is a user required to have. Could a first time internet user access this service?
- How does this compare to analog versions of this service (if any) and how usable is this service versus those services?
- How successful is this service? Is it the main service or are there better competitors (use web site rankings for these statistics)
- Do the usage statistics reflect usability? Are more popular competitors more usable?

Once you have created your one-page report, upload it to the module forum, and comment on at least one other student’s set of examples.

HCD Focus Area: User Experience Design & Iterative Redesign within a Global Context (Modules 3, 9 & 10 combined)
YouTube exemplifies mature Human-Centred Design through its big focus on usability, minimal prior context requirements, and continuous iterative redesign driven by global user behavior and emerging trends (Module 4 & 10).
1. Usability & Learnability (Module 3)
YouTube achieves near-zero friction onboarding: first-time users require no tutorial to play a video, search, or browse recommendations. Core actions (play, pause, search, like, subscribe) are discoverable within 3 seconds via large touch targets, consistent iconography, and progressive disclosure of advanced controls. Autoplay, infinite scroll, and thumbnail-driven content cards reduce cognitive load and decision fatigue, aligning directly with Oviatt’s (2006) cognitive load theory principles covered in Module 12.
2. Prior Context & Accessibility for Novice Users (Module 9 – Global Context)
The platform demands almost no pre-existing digital literacy. A first-time internet user in a rural area can intuitively watch videos using only visual cues and a single search bar — a deliberate inclusive design choice that has driven adoption in emerging markets (India, Indonesia, Brazil now represent >50% of watch time). Language auto-detection, real-time captions, and offline download further lower barriers, demonstrating strong cultural intelligence and localization without sacrificing global consistency.
3. Comparison with Analog Predecessor (Television)
Unlike linear broadcast TV, which enforced scheduled consumption and zero personalization, YouTube’s on-demand, algorithmically curated experience transfers control entirely to the user — a transformational shift that embodies Module 10’s “breaking point” concept. The introduction of YouTube Shorts (2020) was a direct HCD-driven response to TikTok’s rise, proving rapid, evidence-based iteration when user behavior changed.
4. Success Metrics Reflecting HCD Effectiveness
As of Q3 2025, YouTube records 2.8 billion monthly logged-in users and >1 billion hours watched daily (Statista, 2025; YouTube Culture & Trends Report, 2025). Its dominance (no serious competitor exceeds 15% of its watch time) directly correlates with superior usability and continuous user-centred redesign cycles.
In summary, YouTube’s enduring market leadership is not accidental — it is the result of rigorous, iterative, globally inclusive Human-Centred Design that consistently minimizes cognitive load, eliminates prior-context barriers, and rapidly responds to cultural and behavioral shifts.
