## Module 4 - Trend-Based Design

### Core Idea
Trend-based design connects emerging behaviors, technologies and social values to future product opportunities
Instead of guessing what users want, it observes patterns of change (in culture, economy, tech, etc) and translates them into design strategy

## Module 4 - Trend-Based Design

Benefits of trend-based design:
1) Stronger human connection, by keeping products emotionally and culturally relevant by reflecting real users values and interests
2) Cross disciplinary collab: design, Mkt, research, engineering working together on solutions
3) Enhancing customer satisfaction and engagement through relevant and timely deisngs
4) Gaining a competitive edge by offering products aligned with current market demands
5) Driving innovation and creativity by leveraging emerging patterns and insights

Identify the top 5 tech and design trends in 2026
- sustainable solutions in material/energy
- gen AI as core design tool
- quantum computing in financial modeling/logistics
- next-gen cyber security attached to UX
- home automation advanced features

## Module 8 - Designing within a Social Context

### Introduction
- Importance of considering context in all aspects of design.
- Just as some tools require fine motor control, products and designs are influenced by their social contexts

There are a number of methods that can be used to design within a social context, such as:
- Contextual inquiry: This involves observing people in their natural environment to understand their needs and challenges.
- Rapid prototyping: This involves creating quick and dirty prototypes of products or services to test with users.
- Participatory design: This involves working with users to co-design products or services.

## Module 9 - Designing for a Global Context

### Introduction
- Importance of designing products and services that are culturally sensitive and globally applicable.
- Understanding diverse user needs and preferences across different markets and contexts.

### Key Concepts
- Cultural intelligence: Ability to function effectively in diverse cultural environments.
- Localisation vs. globalisation: Balancing standardisation with cultural adaptation.
- Inclusive design: Creating solutions that are accessible and usable by people of all abilities and backgrounds.

### Methods and Tools
- Cross-cultural research: Gathering insights from users in different cultural contexts.
- Ethnographic studies: Immersive research to understand cultural practices and values.
- Co-creation workshops: Involving users from different cultures in the design process.

## Module 10 - The Breaking Point - How to Redesign with HCD in Mind

### The breaking point
- Every product or service has a breaking point.
- This is the moment when it is no longer meeting the needs of its users
- When a product reaches its breaking point, it is time for a redesign.

### Extra signs or reasons behind product redesign
1) when internal kpi's fail... declines in conversion, retention, sucess rate
2) when technology becomes obselete, slow performance, sec vulnerabilities, no compatibility with modern devices

### Three other examples of either successful or failed product / app redesign
1. Skype
- Breaking point: pressure from Snapchat, WhatsApp, and Messenger drove Skype to reinvent itself as a social platform rather than a communication tool.
- HCD sol: Added “Highlights” (Snapchat-style stories), cluttered the interface with social features, and pushed core calling functionality deeper into menus.
- Outcome: Users rejected the redesign, citing confusion and loss of core utility. Microsoft had to reverse many changes
 
2. Zoom
- Breaking Point: During and post-pandemic fatigue, confusing navigation, scattered features (Meetings, Team Chat, Mail, Calendar) created friction for business and casual users.
- HCD Solution: unified the product suite under a single left-hand navigation, simplified meeting controls, improved accessibility + enhanced visual hierarchy for clarity.
- Outcome: reduced cognitive load, smoother onboarding, and stronger adoption among enterprise users.
 
3. Twitter → X
- Breaking Point: leadership shift that created an abrupt rebranding push + identity crisis as features, navigation, and community norms no longer aligned with user expectations.
- HCD Solution: introduced a new minimalist visual identity, dark UI theme, and reorganized menus to support the “everything app” vision.
- Output: Massive backlash, loss of long-held brand equity, user confusion, and declining trust

## Module 12 - HCD in the Field

1. **Human-Centered Design meets Cognitive Load Theory: designing interfaces that help people think.**

One of the main justifications for developing a human-centered design approach for a company is to make tools and systems more usable. This particular paper deals with the concept of developing interfaces that minimise a user’s cognitive load – allowing them more mental capacity to deal with other tasks.

Ensure you cover Section 1.1 to start off with – in particular the two examples – interface strategies 1 and 2. Take note of the required developments that the authors propose are made – in particular, the catering to dynamic changes, reducing variability, and creating more robust systems for users to interact with. Note the statistic used in the form-based example on page 2 – and 80% decrease in disfluencies through creating a more structured interface. Consider how creating a more structured or rigorous system could facilitate ease of use for humans in general. In particular, also note the comments made regarding cognition – load is decreased due to the decreased amount of thought required. Also note the points made immediately after example 2 – supporting a multimodal interface creates a way for humans to efficiently adapt their thought processes and allows them to expand their range of problem solving ability.

Cover Section 2 for the context surrounding cognitive load, and consider the mental resources the average user may have when interacting with a product. From there, move to Section 3 – which deals specifically with the results gained from applying theory in section 2 to the interface concepts. Note section 3.1’s information before beginning, so the context surrounding the tests is clear. In Section 3.2, note that the results – in particular stylus and paper – were much higher than either of the tablet interface, due to the familiarity (or similarity) compared to the pen and paper interface that the students were more familiar with. Note also that the two pen-based systems were much more successful due to (through the lens of cognitive load theory) these similarities as well.

2. **Practice theory and Human-Centered Design: a sustainable Bathing example.**

This resource examines the process of bathing from both a practice theory and human-centered perspective. Ensure that the Practice Theory section on page 2 is covered, to gain the appropriate context before continuing. Ensure that the vegetable examples (both 1 and 2) are covered before moving on to the Human-Centered Design subsection, to understand the authors’ perspective on the process as well.

From here, move down to the Bathing Project subsection on page 3. Note that like the resource in module 11, there are three different cultures covered – this time, India, The Netherlands, and Japan. Each of these has different tendencies – all covered in the cultural inquiry section. Ensure you cover the Industry Project section on page 4 as the next step, and consider how the company translated each of the cultural tendencies into an appropriate process. The two options – scoop and scrub – are translated from the cultural inputs. Also, ensure you cover the justification, particularly regarding both the Netherlands and Japan and their relationship with daily showering or bathing and its increasing tendency over the past 50 years.

Pay particular note in each section to the discussion surrounding energy and resource consumption as well. While Human-Centered Design’s central focus is the Human, as we have discussed in previous modules the environment (or other external factors) can often be motivators for users to engage with a design, product, or process. Note the large energy reduction for splash – up to 90% less warm water can be used than a traditional method discussed earlier. The discussion surrounding the Splash’s effectiveness is the evidence of the Human-Centered Design process here, and the consideration regarding its ‘effectiveness’ is something designers would consider when designing the appropriate systems to facilitate the ‘Splashing’ process. From here, move down to the final section – HCD – on page 6. Ensure you cover this section, and the final conclusion, in detail, as it accurately summarises how the approach adheres to HCD principles. Pay particular note to the discussions around iterating on final processes, and difficulties on getting participants to develop their different ways of bathing – and the lack of input on the part of the designers and researchers.

HCD was about human centric approach with an approach towards people

Problem + People that have the problem = Collaborative Design

As humans, previous generation was used to compete vs human.
Now, we are living on the era of human AI competition!

The Iceberg Project: We had a brief discussion about the article release by MIT 7 days ago stating that 12% of the US workforce can be replaced by AI.

Fascinating times we're experiencing!
