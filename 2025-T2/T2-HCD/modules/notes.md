# Notes for HCD502

## Module 1 - Introduction to Human Centered Design (HCD)

Key principles:
user-centred - goals, preferences, and goals of end-users
hollistic - considers broader context in which design will be used
sustainable - minimize negative imapct and maximize positive impact
iterative - continuous process of testing and learning
collaborative - collaboration among stakeholders

process:
research > ideate > prototype > test > implement

## Takeways:
- Share work in progress with Omid Haass
- Form group by end of week 4

## Questions for Dr. Omid Haass:
1. Assessment #2 - Adoption of new techologies and the impact it has on society: should we do it following up assessment #1?
> R: Up to us... it can either be the same or different. Dr. Omid suggests to do it different (maybe FDS, Tesla).

## Module 4 - Trend-Based Design

### Core Idea
Trend-based design connects emerging behaviors, technologies and social values to future product opportunities
Instead of guessing what users want, it observes patterns of change (in culture, economy, tech, etc) and translates them into design strategy

## Module 4 - Trend-Based Design

Benefits of trend-based design:
1) Stronger human connection, by keeping products emotionally and culturally relevant by reflecting real users values and interests
2) Cross disciplinary collab: design, Mkt, research, engineering working together on solutions
3) Enhancing customer satisfaction and engagement through relevant and timely deisngs
4) Gaining a competitive edge by offering products aligned with current market demands
5) Driving innovation and creativity by leveraging emerging patterns and insights

Identify the top 5 tech and design trends in 2026
- sustainable solutions in material/energy
- gen AI as core design tool
- quantum computing in financial modeling/logistics
- next-gen cyber security attached to UX
- home automation advanced features

## Module 5 - The Art of Ideation

### Intro
Ideation is the process of generating and developing ideas for a product or service. It is a key step in the design process, as it helps to identify and prioritize potential solutions to a problem.

### Techniques
- Brainstorming
- Mind mapping
- Storyboarding
- SCAMPER
- Six Thinking Hats

## Module 6 - Empathising with the Problem Space

### Context
What is the problem space: landscape of challenges, needs and pain points. 
It involves understanding the context, constraints and underlying causes of a problem.

### Methods
1. User research techniques
2. Persona Development
3. Empathy Mapping
4. Journey Mapping

### Examples
- Empathetic Design for Online Shopping - Amazon
- Human-Centered Design in Software Development - Slack
- Streamlining Project Collaboration - Atlassian Jira

### Conclusion
- Empathy is a fundamental aspect of Human-Centered Design, enabling a
deep understanding of user needs.
- Empathizing with the problem space uncovers valuable insights and reveals opportunities for innovation.
- Utilize various methods and best practices to effectively empathize with users.
- Empathetic design leads to more meaningful and impactful solutions that resonate with users.

## Module 7 - Transformational Thinking

### Questions:
1. Assessment #1 marks: you added a few comments, how much time do we have? Is it possible to obtain changes in grades with that?

### 3 steps of transformational thinking:
1. Understanding the problem
2. What needs to change?
3. Implementation and iteration

### Tools and Techniques
- Problem tree analysis: Identify root causes and relationships
- Stakeholder analysis: Map key players and their interests
- Backcasting: Work backwards from desired future state
- Design thinking: Human-centered problem solving approach
- Systems thinking: Understand interconnected components and feedback loops

## Module 8 - Designing within a Social Context

### Introduction
- Importance of considering context in all aspects of design.
- Just as some tools require fine motor control, products and designs are influenced by their social contexts

There are a number of methods that can be used to design within a social context, such as:
- Contextual inquiry: This involves observing people in their natural environment to understand their needs and challenges.
- Rapid prototyping: This involves creating quick and dirty prototypes of products or services to test with users.
- Participatory design: This involves working with users to co-design products or services.
