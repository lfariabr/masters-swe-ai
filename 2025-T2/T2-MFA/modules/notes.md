# Notes for MFA502

## Module 1 - Introduction to Machine Learning (MFA)

### I. Introduction to Set Theory
    - Set → A collection of objects.
        - A carpenter’s tool box → set.
        - All presidents of USA → set.
        - Your ten best friends → set.
        - All the programming languages → Set.
    - We understand sets intuitively.
    - The objects in a set may be similar or different.
    - A set may contain finite number of objects → Finite Sets
    - A set might contain infinite number of objects → Infinite Sets
> A set is a collection of items which have a common trait

Collection of tall boys: Not a set
Collection of boys higher than 1.8m: Set

{ x | x=2k (k is an integer); and 1<=x<=100 } is the set of even numbers
![set of even numbers](./module_01_introduction-to-sets-functions-and-vectors/setOfEvenNumbers.png)

### Activity 1 - 15'
1) Identify three different sets
> set1 `even numbers less than 12` = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 }  
> set2 `common household pets` = { cat, dog, rabbit, guinea pig } 
> set3 `top 5 tech companies` = { apple, google, amazon, microsoft, meta } 

- how many elements does each have? 
> n(set1) = 5
> n(set2) = 4
> n(set3) = 5

- are they well-defined? 
> yes

- what are its elements?
> set1 = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 }
> set2 = { cat, dog, rabbit, guinea pig }
> set3 = { apple, google, amazon, microsoft, meta }

- would everyone agree with the elements?
> I believe so, since the membership is clear

2) Give two example of a null set
> Ø1 = {x | x is a natural number less than 0 } -> no such number meets this condition
> Ø2 = {x | x is a student who scored 11 out of a 10 exam } -> not possible

3) Give two example of a universal set
> context = numbers up to 20 -> U1 = {1, 2, …, 20}
> context = programming languages -> U2 = {Python, Javascript, Java, C++, C#, ...}

### II. Subsets
A = {1,2,3}
B = {x|0<=x<=50}
A⊆B // A is a subset of B

Conceptual Activity:
N⊆Z⊆Q⊆R

### III. Some Operations in Set Theory

Power set
If A has n members, then the power set of A has 2^n members
`pow(A) = {x | x⊆A}`

Example:
if A={a,b}
Then pow (A) has 2^2 = 4 members
That is: `pow({a,b}) = {{}, {a}, {b}, {a,b}}`

Intersection of sets:

## Module 3A - Matrices

### I. An Introduction to Linear Algebra
- A branch of Abstract Mathematics
- Deals with linear relationships between variables
- Hermann Grassmann (1844): published his "Theory of Extension"
- Linear Algebra → deeper understanding of machine learning.
- The most important concept in linear algebra → Matrix Theory

### II. Introduction to Matrices
Matrices provide:
- a systematic approach for arranging large arrays of values
- simplify analysis of large amounts of data
- simplify analysis of large arrays of equations and their solutions
- simplify computer algorithms for manipulating large arrays of data

Matrices and Hard Disk Memory
Using matrices → we can correlate a unique address to every data point in memory of a hard disk

Definitions
Horizontal rows -> m
Vertical columns -> n
m x n = size of matrix
element (i,j) = element in row i and column j

### III. Few Important Matrices
- Scalar
- Row and Columns
- Square
- Diagonal
- Identity
- Zero
- Upper Triangular
- Lower Triangular

### IV. Fundamental Operations on Matrices
- Transpose of a Matrix
    - A' = T(A)
    - m x n will become n x m
    - T(T(A)) = A

- Equality of Matrices
    - A = B if and only if:
    - A and B have the same size
    - Corresponding elements of both matrices are equal

- Addition and Subtraction
    - Add: A2x2+B2x2 = a1+b1, a2+b2, a3+b3, a4+b4
    - Sub: A2x2-B2x2 = a1-b1, a2-b2, a3-b3, a4-b4

- Multiplication
    - Two matrices can be multiplied if and only if:
    - the number of columns in the first matrix 
    - **is equal** 
    - to the number of rows in the second matrix
    - Amxn * Bnxk = Cmxk

- Division?
    - There is no division of matrices
    - However, matrix inversion can be viewed in some sense as a procedure similar to division

- Important properties
    - AB != BA
    - (AB)C = A(BC)
    - A(B+C) = AB + AC
    - (B+C)A = BA + CA

### V. Determinants

- The determinant of a matrix A is defined only for a *square matrix*
- It is a *scalar* value
- Various representations are shown as:
    - det(A), |A|, *delta*

#### Determinant of a 2x2 matrix
A = [ a11 a12
     a21 a22 ]
    
det(A) = a11a22 - a12a21

#### Determinant of a 3x3 matrix
A = [ **a11** **a12** **a13**
     a21 a22 a23
     a31 a32 a33 ]

det(A) = **a11**(a22a33 - a23a32) - **a12**(a21a33 - a23a31) + **a13**(a21a32 - a22a31)

If det(A) = 0, then A is singular

### VI. Inverse Matrix
- The inversed of a matrix A is denoted as A^-1
- A matrix is inversible → det(A) ≠ 0
- If A is inversible, then A^-1 is also inversible = AA^-1 = A^-1A = I

#### Inverse of a 2x2 matrix
A = [ a11 a12
     a21 a22 ]

> 1) Change the location of elements on the main diagonal
> 2) Multiply the other two elements in (-1)
> 3) Divide the matrix by det(A)

A^-1 = [ (a22/det(A)) (-a12/det(A))
         (-a21/det(A)) (a11/det(A)) ]

## Module 3B - Fundamentals of Linear Algebra
Linear Transformations, Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

### I. Image Processing
- Image processing → operations performed on images to improve quality or extract information.
- In real-world applications, images are represented as collections of pixels.

My take:
> "Instead of trying to make computers draw hyper-realistic images from scratch, this method uses real photos as puzzle pieces.
Each face of a 3D object (like the sides of a cube or the panels of a car) is captured as a real photo. 
> Using projective transformations (basically mathematical formulas that let you tilt, rotate, and scale images correctly in 3D space), the computer assembles these flat photos to make the full 3D object appear real.
> The result looks like a realistic model you can move or view from different angles, perfect for 3D vision (stereo) or animation.

### II. Transformation
T: S -> S'
P(x,y,z) -> P'(x',y',z')

### III. Two types of Transformation
- Linear: preservers linear relationships between variables
- Non-linear: changes linear relationships between variables

** Reflection **

1) What do you understand from transformation?

A transformation is a mathematical operation that changes an object’s position, size, or orientation while possibly preserving or altering its shape. In computing terms, it’s when input data (like coordinates, pixels, or signals) is mapped to a new form according to a specific rule — often expressed using matrices. For example, rotating, scaling, or translating an image are all forms of transformations.

⸻

2) Have you used transformation before? What was the case?

Yes, I’ve used transformations while converting and manipulating images — for instance, resizing, rotating, or converting formats (like JPG to PNG). I’ve also worked with coordinate transformations when positioning UI elements or plotting graphs in Python. These all involve some form of linear transformation where data points are mapped to new coordinate spaces.

⸻

3) In your opinion, where is linear transformation used in computer science?

Linear transformations are everywhere in computer science — especially in graphics, machine learning, and data processing. In 2D and 3D graphics, they’re used to rotate, scale, and project objects onto screens. In AI, they appear in matrix operations inside neural networks where weights transform input data into feature representations. They’re also used in simulations, robotics, and signal processing to model linear relationships.

⸻

4) In your opinion, where is non-linear transformation used in computer science?

Non-linear transformations appear when the relationship between input and output isn’t proportional or predictable. They’re used in route optimization, encryption, neural networks (activation functions), image enhancement, and computer vision. In these cases, data must be warped or mapped in complex ways that can’t be described by simple matrix multiplication — non-linear transformations capture that complexity.

### IV. Linear Transformation
Properties:
TBD

### V. Geometrical Interpretation of Matrices
Point A
Line segment AB
Triangle ABC
Square ABCD

### VI. Matrix Transformation
#### Exercise 3 - Linear Transformation by Matrices

1. Prove a 2×2 matrix is a linear transformation:
T(x) = A·x
A = [[a, b], [c, d]]
T(x) = [a*x1 + b*x2, c*x1 + d*x2]
→ T(x1 + x2) = T(x1) + T(x2)
→ T(c·x) = c·T(x)
✅ Linear

2. Prove a 3×3 matrix is linear:
Same logic applies. Matrix multiplication distributes over + and scalar *.

3. Conclusion:
Any n×n (or m×n) matrix represents a linear transformation, since:
A(x1 + x2) = A·x1 + A·x2
A(c·x) = c·A·x
✅ Linear for all dimensions.

#### VII. Different types of Matrix Transformation
- 2D Translation
- Scaling
- Rotation
- Shears
- Reflection
- Projections

## Module 4 - Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

### I. Conceptual Analysis
- A matrix transforms a vector — usually changing both:
	1.	Magnitude (how long it is)
	2.	Direction (where it points)
- But some special vectors (called eigenvectors) are only stretched or shrunk, not rotated.
The scalar (number) that describes how much it is stretched or shrunk is the eigenvalue (λ).

In equation form:
A x = λx
where:
A = matrix,
x = eigenvector,
λ = eigenvalue.

### II. Parallel Vectors

Two vectors are parallel if one is a scalar multiple of the other:

V = λU
Examples:

- [2,1,5] and [10,5,25] → parallel
- [2,1,5] and [-2,-1,-5] → parallel (but opposite direction)

### III. Conceptual Examples

(General Case)

A 3×3 matrix multiplies a vector — both direction and magnitude change.
This is the “normal” transformation case.

(Special Case)

For certain vectors, the direction remains the same; only the length changes.
That’s where eigenvectors appear:

A V = λ V

If this holds true,
- λ → eigenvalue of A
- V → eigenvector of A

### IV. Meaning of “Eigen”
- The word “Eigen” comes from German — meaning “own” or “typical”.
→ “Eigenvector” = “own direction” of the matrix
→ “Eigenvalue” = “own scale” or “stretch factor” of the matrix

### V. Geometrical Intuition
- The matrix acts as a transformation that can:
- Rotate
- Stretch
- Compress
- Reflect
- But along certain axes, it just scales the vector:
- Blue arrow (eigenvector) keeps direction.
- Red arrow (regular vector) changes direction.

If eigenvalue λ = 1 → vector length unchanged.
If λ > 1 → stretched.
If 0 < λ < 1 → shrunk.
If λ < 0 → flipped direction.

### VI. Visual Analogy
- Imagine a rubber sheet being pulled — most directions bend, but some stretch straight.
Those straight lines are the eigen-directions.

### VII. Application in Machine Learning
- Big matrices (data) are computationally heavy.
- Using eigen decomposition, we can represent them with smaller sets of key components:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Feature compression
- Dimensionality reduction
- Image and face recognition (“Eigenfaces”)

Eigenvalues + eigenvectors summarize large datasets efficiently.

### VIII. Reflection Questions (from slides)
1.	What is an eigenvector / eigenvalue?
→ An eigenvector is a direction that remains unchanged in orientation after transformation.
→ Its corresponding eigenvalue tells how much it’s scaled.
2.	Where is it used in AI/ML?
→ PCA, data compression, facial recognition, recommendation systems.
3.	What makes them special?
→ They do not rotate; they preserve direction.
4.	Geometrical interpretation?
→ Fixed-direction scaling.
5.	Have I coded this before?
→ Yes — in Python scripts for 2×2 and 3×3 matrices without using NumPy.

### Reflection
1. What is an eigenvector? What is an eigenvalue?
> Eigenvector → direction in space that remains unchanged in orientation after transformation.
> Eigenvalue (λ) → scale factor that defines how much the eigenvector is stretched, compressed or flipped.

2. What is the application of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in AI/ML?
> Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are used in AI/ML for reduction of dimensions and feature/data compression.

3. What is the characteristic that distinguishes between eigenvectors and other matrix transformations?
> Eigenvectors are special because they do not change direction under a transformation — they are only scaled. Other vectors are rotated or sheared, but eigenvectors preserve their alignment.

4. What is the geometrical interpretation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors?
> Geometrically, a matrix transformation can stretch, rotate, or reflect a shape. Eigenvectors represent the axes of pure scaling, where the transformation acts as a simple stretch or compression.
> The eigenvalue tells how much the vector is scaled along that axis:
>- λ > 1 → stretched
>- 0 < λ < 1 → compressed
>- λ < 0 → flipped to the opposite direction

5. Have you ever used this mathematical concept before?
> R: I believe so when training machine learning models using scikit-learn, but I imagine it abstracts the concept and math away from it.

## Module 6 - Derivatives and Integrals

Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change. Geometry is the branch of mathematics that focuses on the study of shapes. 
The core concepts of calculus—differentiation and integration—are built on the idea of limits, which allows us to analyze how things change over infinitesimally small intervals. 

More to come...

## Module 5 - Derivatives and Integrals

### I. Introduction to Calculus
Branch of mathematics, originally from the calculus of infinitesimals.Developed by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz at the same time in the late 17th century.

Differential calculus: study of rates at which quantities change
Integral calculus: study the area under a curve

### II. Mapping & Relations

#### Conceptual example
set A: {Benz, Bentley, Jaguar}
set B: {Red, Blue, Green}

f: A -> B
f(Benz) = Red
f(Bentley) = Blue
f(Jaguar) = Green

#### Mapping
Correlating members of one set A with/to members of another set B
The relation R maps elements of set A to elements of set B:
R: A -> B

#### Ordered Pair
Cartesian product of two sets A and B
Denoted A x B
A x B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}

#### Cartesian Multiplication
- Note 1: (X,Y) != (Y,X)
- Note 2: RXR = R^2 (*Plane*)
- Note 3: RXRXR = R^3 (*Space*)
- Note 4: RxRxRx... = R^n (*n*)

#### Relation
- One to one mapping
- Many to one mapping
- One to many mapping (not interested on this in Calculus)
- Many to many mapping (not interested on this in Calculus)

### III. Functions

#### Conceptual example
- set A: {Milk, Sugar, Flavor} -> inputs(x)
- Ice Cream Machine (f: A -> B)
- set B: {Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry} -> outputs(y)

`f: A -> B`
- x is the input -> independent variable
- y is the output -> dependent variable

> The same input can't generate different outputs

#### Variables
- A function may have several independent variable, set of all inputs = A
- A function may have several dependent variable, set of all outputs = B

#### Function vs Relations
It can be one-to-one or many-to-one mapping, meaning they have a well-behaved relation.

#### Domain and Range
Domain: set of all possible inputs
Range: set of all possible outputs

#### Rules for functions
1. Not divide by zero
2. Not take the square root of a negative number
3. Not defined

### IV. Limits

Limits study the behavior of function. Thinki about y = 1/x
How to find? Starting from a point, example:
x = 0,01
x = 0,00001
x = 0,0000001
...

#### Concept of limit - informal
As x approaches 0, y approaches infinity.

#### Definition of limit - informal
If x -> value c from either sides -> the value of (fx) approaches a real number L, then:
Lim f(x) = L (as x -> c)

#### Definition of limit - formal
If for every positive number epsilon, there exists a positive number delta such that for all x in the domain of f, if 0 < |x - c| < delta, then |f(x) - L| < epsilon, then:
Lim f(x) = L (as x -> c)

### V. Continuity
It is a function that does not have any abrupt changes in value, known as discontinuities.

#### Types of discontinuities
1. Removable discontinuity
2. Jump discontinuity
3. Essential discontinuity

#### Continuity Test
```python
1. f(c) exists              # c lies in the domain of f
2. lim x->c f(x) exists     # f has a limit as x -> c
3. lim x->c f(x) = f(c)     # the limit equals the function value at c
```

## Module 5B - Differential Calculus

### I - Derivatives
Derivatives are used to calculate the rate of change of a function at a given point.

### II - Derivative of functions
The derivative of a function f at a point x is defined as:
f'(x) = lim[Δx->0] [f(x+Δx) - f(x)] / Δx

We can calculate the derivative of common functions using rules like:
- Power rule: d/dx[x^n] = nx^(n-1)
- Constant rule: d/dx[c] = 0
- Sum/Difference rule: d/dx[f(x) ± g(x)] = f'(x) ± g'(x)
- Product rule: d/dx[f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)
- Chain rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x))g'(x)
> Master these five and solve most problems!

### III - Differentiability of a function
A function is differentiable at a point if its derivative exists at that point.

### IV - Some applications
- Absolute and local maxima/minima
- Monotonic functions
- Maximum, Minimum & Slope
- Concavity and convexity
- Applied optimization problems

### V - Exercises
Define the following:

1. Absolute maximum: global **peak** on an interval
2. Absolute minimum: global **valley** on an interval
3. Local maximum: x = c, means f(c) is the **biggest** value in the neighborhood around c
4. Local minimum: x = c, means f(c) is the **smallest** value in a neighborhood around c
5. Critical points: x-values where f'(x) = 0 or f'(x) is undefined
6. First derivative test for local extreme values: 
    - If f'(x) changes from positive to negative at x = c, then f(c) is a local maximum
    - If f'(x) changes from negative to positive at x = c, then f(c) is a local minimum
7. Increasing functions: if x1 < x2, then f(x1) < f(x2), meaning **if x goes up, y goes up**
8. Decreasing functions: if x1 < x2, then f(x1) > f(x2), meaning **if x goes up, y goes down**
9. Monotonic functions: a function that is either increasing or decreasing on the given interval I
10. First derivative test for monotonic functions: we find f'(x) and check if it is positive or negative on the interval I to define if the function is increasing or decreasing
11. Determine local maxima or minima of function: y = f(x) = x^5 - 8x^3 + x + 2
