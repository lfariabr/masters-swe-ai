## Assessment 3
### Assessment 3: **Project Brief** 
Assessment: Solve an AI Problem set
Length: _
Due Date: 03/12/2025

#### Summary: 
The second assessment allowed you to show your understanding on how to choose the correct AI method to solve simple case studies. Assessment 3 has been designed to assess your ability in choosing and using the best AI methods to solve larger and more challenging problems. The AI method that you will be using is more challenging to implement as compared to those in the second assessment. Solving real-world problems using AI techniques requires more sophisticated skills, and you will demonstrate these in this assessment.

Your subject facilitator will provide you with the scenario/topic/focus for this assessment during the first few weeks of this subject. Regardless of the content that will be provided, you will have to first understand the problem and formulate it in a suitable manner for AI techniques. The next step is to choose the correct AI method to solve the problem. As a part of development, you have to test and analyse the performance of the AI technique to ensure that it gives optimal results. In summary, you will be required to program an AI method, solve a problem using it, and write a reflective report.

#### Context:
Facilitator will advise you of the exact task you are required to complete during the first few weeks of the subject.

#### Instructions:
The source code that you will be submitting should be free of build warnings, build errors, and all intermediate files (.obj, .pdb, etc), crashes, and errors (compile, run-time, logical, etc.). Your code should be structured and written with the best practices in the field of programming. There should
be enough number of comments in the source files to show your understanding of the program. Any third-party code should be appropriately attributed.

When you submit the electronic version of your project make sure to use the following names:
- Name the source code folder as: Source – Student Name
- Name the solution as: YourGameName.sln

#### Submission Instructions
You are supposed to submit a ZIP file including:
- Release Build Zip: A release build executable must be zipped and included with the submission. Ensure that project settings are set to Release when creating this build.
- Source Code Zip: All relevant source code files and project files must be zipped and included with the submission
- Reflective report: PDF or Word
- Naming & File structure for the zip file.

### Details
1. Generate a random 10×10 matrix (binary image).
2. Define a target image.
3. Implement a cost function to measure difference.
4. Use hill climbing to iteratively improve the random image.
5. Stop when the cost is low or no further improvement occurs.
6. Print/visualize each iteration.
