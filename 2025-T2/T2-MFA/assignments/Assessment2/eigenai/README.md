# EigenAI 
## Smart Tutor for Math/Programming

## What is EigenAI?

EigenAI plays on "eigenvalues" and AI foundations".

It is a learning assistant web app for Torrens' Mathematical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence subject and can work as a tutor for students interested in math/programming subjects.

The app will act as a companion tutor that walks students through each problem set interactively ‚Äî showing process, formulas, and results with animations.
