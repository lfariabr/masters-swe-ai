## Assessment 2
### Assessment 2 Brief: **Briefing** 
Assessment: Research Tools and Methodologies
Length: 1,500 words
Due Date: 09/11/2025

#### Summary: 
You will need to write a report. This assessment task is designed to help determine the research methodology and, subsequently, the research tools needed, based on the literature review that you have conducted in Assessment Task 1. The focus of this Assessment Task 2 here is on a comparative analysis of research methodologies that will assist you in preparing your final assessment—Assessment Task 3, your Research Proposal.

#### Context:
This assessment task, a report on Research Methodologies and Tools is formative in nature and constitutes the second stage in your work towards your final Research Proposal (Assessment Task 3). Each assessment task in this subject is designed to build competency in research methodologies and, as such, are not stand-alone assessment tasks. Assessment task 2 is designed to help you decide on the research methodologies that are appropriate for you to conduct your research.

This assessment task requires you, as a Software Engineering or an Information Technology (IT) student, to research and prepare a comparative analysis of the different research methodologies available depending on the nature of research that you wish to embark on, i.e., academic or industry-based research. Accordingly, you will have to consider either academic or industry (IT)-based research methodologies. Therefore, the methodologies, such as qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods, design science or prototyping, should be analysed to determine what would be the best approach for your Research Proposal (Assessment 3 in Week 12). Once you have determined the methodological approach that you wish to follow, you will need to decide on the types of research tools that you will need. Research instruments (or tools) may include surveys, questionnaires, interviews, focus groups, and quantitative statistical analysis, among others. For example, if you plan to use a survey, a questionnaire or an interview, you need to write the specific questions that you intend to ask and describe the data analysis method that you will apply to the responses that you will collect. Please include the questionnaire in the Appendix.

#### Instructions:
The Comparative Analysis Report is an individual assessment and accounts for 30% of your overall grade in this subject. Your report should have a word count of 1,500 words (+/-10%) including the following key elements:

1. The structure and contents of the Assessment task 2 is as follows:
- The title of your research
- Research questions (Modified version based on Assessment 1 feedback). Aims and objectives (Modified version based on Assessment 1 feedback).
- Comparative Analysis of research methodologies.
- Proposed methodology and research methods.
- Rationale for the choice of research method
- Ethical consideration.
- Data analysis strategies and tools.
- References.
- Appendices (if applicable).

2. To undertake comparative analysis of research methodologies, you need to consider an analytical approach to evaluate qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research methodologies. Outline the strengths andweaknesses of each approach in relation to your proposed research project.
What steps does each approach utilise? What are the limitations associated with each approach? Justify why the approach is still selected despite the limitations.

3. To propose a methodology for your research project, based on the analysis
conducted as step 2 above, you need to determine which research
methodology (i. e., qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods) is appropriate
for your research project. Discuss the reasons behind your choice of
methodology. Outline the software design, relate the methodologies and
methods to the research question(s). Indicate the following points:
- a. What methods are being used to address the research question(s)?
- b. What tools/research instruments are you planning on using?
- c. How do you plan on triangulating the data that you will collect?
- d. What ethical issues need to be taken into consideration?
- e. How have ethical considerations influenced the development of your research tools?

Note that the terms used in the steps listed above are defined as follows:
- **Methodology** is a systematic examination of the methods applied to any research field. It may be comprised of a system of methods designed to achieve the research outcome.
- **Methods** are the particular tools/research instruments that are intended for being used. (e.g., qualitative interviews, or quantitative statistical analysis).
- **Ethics** is an important issue when developing specific research tools, particularly when conducting research involving humans.

4. Appendices: You need to include any tools/research instruments that you have developed in this section. Please use different appendices (e.g., Appendix A, Appendix B) for different instruments. Appendices do NOT count towards your report’s word count.

#### Referencing

It is essential that you use appropriate APA style for citing and referencing research. Please see more information on referencing here http://library.laureate.net.au/research_skills/referencing
