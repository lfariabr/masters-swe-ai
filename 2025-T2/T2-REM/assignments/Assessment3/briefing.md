## Assessment 3
### Assessment 3 Brief: **Briefing** 
Assessment: Research Proposal
Length: 2,500 words + Presentation (5-7 minutes)
Due Date: 03/12/2025

#### Summary: 
This task is an individual assessment and accounts for 40% of your overall
grade. It is designed to provide the direction of your future research project.
You are required to develop the research proposal based on the research
problem and question(s) formulated in Assessment Task 1 and the
methodology and research tools determined in Assessment Task 2.
Ensure that you take into consideration the University ethos “Here for Good”
in your research. approach. Please refer to the Task Instructions section
below for details on how to complete this task.

#### Context:
This assessment task, a Research Proposal and Presentation, is the final
assessment task for this subject. This assessment requires you to prepare a
report and presentation that outlines you proposed research project.

The Research Proposal and Presentation should prepare you to produce clear
specifications regarding the what, when, where, why and how of your research project.

#### Instructions

This assessment task consists of two parts:

##### **Part 1:** Research Proposal Presentation

Create and present a 5–7-minute presentation in either PowerPoint or as a PDF
containing the following information:

- Title slide
    - Include your name and student number along with the Title of the
    Project Proposal (retrieved from Assessment task 1 and redrafted based on the feedback of your learning facilitator).
- Introduction
    - Research problem statement.
    - Research questions (retrieved from Assessment 1 and redrafted based on the feedback of your learning facilitator).
    - Aims and objectives.
- Positioning the work in the field (Findings from the critical Literature
review)
    - Use figures which includes tables, charts, graphs, infographics, etc. rather than words.
    - Bullet points.
- Proposed Methodology
    - Use diagrams and examples of data visualisation to show your approach.
- Methods
    - Show examples of your research instrument/tools (e.g., a sample of the survey questions used).
    - Outline any ethical issues that may arise and how you plan to overcome them.
- Tentative conclusion
    - Show how your proposed methodology will answer the research questions.
- Timeline
    - Both the report and the presentation should include a timeline (which assumes a 12-week production cycle) showing a breakdown of the tasks involved and when they should be completed. A Gantt chart would be an appropriate tool to use for this section.
- References (no need to talk about the references, just show the slide. Remember to follow APA style guidelines)

##### **Part 2:** Research Proposal Report

The Report that forms part of this assessment task should contain the following sections:
- Title: Usually a single, concise sentence that accurately reflects the topic of the proposed research.
- Introduction: Provides the background and context for the proposed research. It includes the:
    - research questions
    - aims and objectives, and
    - hypothesis.
    - ***The introduction should also address how the research project addresses the University ethos “Here for Good”. The introduction should be 1-2 paragraphs in length.***
- Literature Review using the resources you identified in Assessment task 1, write a literature review that situates your research project in the existing field. Outline the larger context for the research. Determine what research gap your project fills. Feel free to include any/all of the following:
    - Conceptual diagrams.
    - Flow charts.
    - Interface research.
    - Code snippets or pattern.
    - ***Ensure that you use APA style in-text referencing throughout your report. Your literature review should be 1,000-1,500 words long.***
- Methodology and Methods
    - Outline which research methodology (e.g., qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods) will be used for your research project. Describe which methods you intend to use. Outline the software design. Relate the methodologies and methods to the research question(s) – which methods are being used to address the research question(s)? What tools/research instruments are you planning on using?
    - How do you plan on triangulating your data? What ethical issues need to be taken into consideration? How has ethics influenced the development of your research tools?
    - Feel free to include any/all of the following:
        - Conceptual diagrams.
        - Flow charts.
        - Interface research.
        - Code snippets or patterns.
    - For this section, you will need to REWRITE and edit the work that you submitted for the previous assessment task. DO NOT SELF-PLAGIARISE.
- Conclusion
    - A one paragraph summary of the research proposal linking research questions with proposed methodology.
- Proposed Timeline (assuming 12 weeks duration) outlining major deliverables. Gantt chart is recommended.
- Referencing
    - It is essential that you use appropriate APA style for citing and referencing sources used in your research. Please see more information on reference here: http://library.laureate.net.au/research_skills/referencing
- Appendices
    - Appendices contain any tools/research instruments that you have developed.
    - Please use different appendices (e.g., Appendix A, Appendix B) for different instruments. Appendices do NOT count towards your word count.

#### Submission Instructions
The Research Proposal Presentation slides can be submitted as PowerPoint slides or as a PDF. The Research Proposal Report and Presentation slides will be submitted via the Assessment link in the main navigation menu in REM502 Research Methodologies. The Learning Facilitator will provide feedback via the Grade Centre in the Blackboard Learning Management System. Feedback can be viewed in My Grades.

The presentation will take place during the normal class time in Week 12 (Module 12) or the students may submit the link to the pre-recorded presentation in one of the appendices of the final report
