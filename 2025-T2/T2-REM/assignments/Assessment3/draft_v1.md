1. Introduction (expand from Assessment 1 + 2)
   - Healthcare business intelligence gap
   - ICT R&D significance
   
2. Literature Review (refined Assessment 1)
   - Add: theoretical frameworks (Customer Lifetime Value, Service-Profit Chain)
   - Synthesize into research model
   
3. Methodology (Assessment 2 + expansions)
   - Research design justification
   - Population & sampling strategy
   - Instrumentation (NPS survey design critique)
   - Data collection procedures
   - Analysis plan (with statistical formulas)
   - Validity/reliability strategies
   - Ethical protocols
   
4. Expected Outcomes & Contributions
   - Hypothesized findings
   - Practical implications (dashboard prototype?)
   - Theoretical contributions
   
5. Project Plan
   - Gantt chart (data cleaning, analysis, write-up phases)
   - Risk mitigation
   
6. References (expand to 15-20 sources)

Appendices:
- A: Data dictionary

**D. Start Building Now**

| Week | Action | Output |
|------|--------|--------|
| This week | Run preliminary correlation in Python | Draft results section for Assessment 3 |
| Next week | Literature review expansion | Add 5 methodology papers (quantitative design in healthcare) |
| Week after | Ethics documentation | Draft consent forms, data handling protocol |

## 4. Additional HD-Level Recommendations

### Academic Writing Enhancements

**Current Issues:**
1. **Inconsistent citation density**: Section 4 has no in-text citations despite methodological claims
2. **Weak critical voice**: "Best suited to AI research" (p.5) - says who? Need justification
3. **Assertion without evidence**: "accuracy ≥ 90%" (p.8) - this is meaningless without context

**HD-Level Practices:**

1. **Every methodological choice needs citation:**
```
   ❌ "Pearson correlation will be applied"
   ✅ "Pearson correlation will be applied to assess linear relationships 
       between NPS and revenue (Field, 2018), provided data meet parametric 
       assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity (Pallant, 2020)"

Assessment 3 Foundation:

Start literature review expansion now (target: 18-20 sources)
Draft conceptual framework diagram linking variables
Prepare preliminary results from correlation analysis (even if incomplete) to demonstrate feasibility
Document data dictionary as Appendix A foundation
