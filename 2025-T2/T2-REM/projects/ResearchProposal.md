## A Master's Research Journey: Validating Healthcare's Most Popular Metric

*From Critical Literature Review to Full Research Proposal — A trimester-long investigation into whether Net Promoter Score actually predicts revenue in healthcare clinics.*

---

## The Question That Started It All

During my 10+ years managing aesthetic healthcare clinics across Brazil, I witnessed firsthand how Net Promoter Score (NPS) became the golden metric. Every meeting, every dashboard, every strategic decision seemed to revolve around those magic numbers: Promoters (9-10), Passives (7-8), Detractors (0-6).

But here's the uncomfortable truth I kept noticing:

> **No one had ever proven that NPS actually correlates with revenue growth in healthcare.**

Sure, we *assumed* higher NPS meant more revenue. We *believed* patient satisfaction drove financial performance. But where was the empirical evidence?

That question became the foundation of my Master's research at **Torrens University Australia**, under the expert guidance of **Prof. Dr. Bushra Naeem**, a distinguished researcher in digital transformation and ICT methodologies.

## 📚 Assessment 1: Critical Literature Review — Finding the Gap

### What We Discovered

I conducted a systematic literature review analyzing 12+ peer-reviewed studies across six key themes:

1. **Patient Experience Frameworks** (Godovykh & Pizam, 2023)
2. **NPS Evolution and Critique** (Reichheld, 2003; Dawes, 2024)
3. **Loyalty Programs & Information Systems** (Cahya et al., 2025)
4. **AI-Enabled Sentiment Analysis** (Alkhnbashi et al., 2024; Xiao et al., 2022)
5. **Emotional Engagement** (Angelis et al., 2024)
6. **Healthcare-Specific Feedback Analytics** (Shankar & Yip, 2024)

### The Knowledge Gap

Three converging gaps emerged:

**1. Metric Validation Gap**  
NPS guides resource allocation in healthcare despite never being empirically tested as a predictor of clinic-level financial performance.

**2. Business Intelligence Gap**  
Patient feedback analytics inform operational improvements and AI sentiment analysis proves technically feasible, yet neither connects to measurable financial outcomes.

**3. ICT Foundation Gap**  
AI sentiment systems presume sentiment-to-performance correlations that remain statistically unverified, risking investment in systems optimizing wrong outcomes.

### Key Finding

**Zero studies** have quantitatively validated the NPS-revenue relationship in healthcare contexts. This isn't just an academic curiosity — it's a $50,000+ annual investment decision for clinics adopting expensive feedback systems like Medallia or Qualtrics.

## 🔬 Assessment 2: Research Tools and Methodologies — Designing the Study

### Research Questions

Based on the identified gap, I formulated two precise research questions:

**RQ1:** To what extent is Net Promoter Score correlated with monthly revenue growth in healthcare clinics?  
**RQ2:** Can NPS trends predict short-term revenue fluctuations?

### Hypotheses

- **H0:** No significant correlation exists between NPS and revenue (r < 0.3 or p > 0.05)
- **H1:** NPS is positively correlated with revenue growth (r > 0.3, p < 0.05)

### Methodology: Quantitative Correlational Design

**Philosophical Orientation:** Pragmatic-Positivist paradigm (Morgan, 2014)

**Why Quantitative?**  
The research questions are relational, not exploratory. We need statistical evidence, not narrative insights.

### The Dataset

**Source:** Pro-Corpo Estética (Brazilian healthcare group)  
**Size:** ~27,000 aggregated NPS survey responses  
**Timeline:** 36 months (2022-2025)  
**Scope:** Multiple clinic branches across Brazil

**Data Structure:**
- Clinic ID / Store name
- Month & Year
- Average NPS score (0-10 scale)
- Monthly revenue (BRL)
- Number of responses per month

### Analytical Pipeline

```python
# 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Remove duplicates
- Handle missing values (interpolation for isolated gaps)
- Outlier detection (>3 SD flagged for validation)
- Create derived variables: Revenue Growth %, Lagged NPS (t-1, t-2)

# 2. Statistical Analysis
- Descriptive Statistics (mean, SD, distribution)
- Pearson + Spearman Correlation (strength & direction)
- Linear Regression (predictive capacity with temporal lags)
- K-means Clustering (clinic behavioral segmentation)

# 3. Validation
- Cross-validation by clinic and year
- Temporal, spatial, and methodological triangulation
```

### Tools & Technologies

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Data Processing | Python (Pandas, NumPy) |
| Statistical Analysis | SciPy, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn |
| Visualization | Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit |
| Documentation | Jupyter Notebooks |
| Version Control | Git/GitHub |

### Ethics & Governance

✓ **Anonymized Data:** Aggregated at clinic-month level  
✓ **Institutional Consent:** Signed approval from Pro-Corpo  
✓ **Legal Compliance:** LGPD (Brazil) + GDPR + Australian Privacy Act (1988)  
✓ **Researcher Reflexivity:** Documented as former collaborator

## 📊 Assessment 3: Research Proposal — The Full Picture

### Conceptual Framework

**Assumed Pathway (Never Validated):**

```
Patient       NPS         Loyalty        Revenue
Experience  → Score   →  Intent    →?→  Growth
   ✓            ✓          ✓          ?
                    ↑
              BROKEN LINK
```

This study tests whether the "?" is actually a validated connection.

### Expected Contributions & Decision Framework

Regardless of statistical outcome, this research provides actionable intelligence:

**Scenario 1: Strong Correlation (r > 0.7, p < 0.05)**  
✅ **Validate NPS** as strategic KPI  
✅ Simple tracking systems sufficient  
✅ Cost-effective patient monitoring justified

**Scenario 2: Moderate Correlation (0.3 < r < 0.7, p < 0.05)**  
⚠️ **Partial validation** — NPS provides some signal  
⚠️ Justify investment in AI sentiment enhancement  
⚠️ Richer feedback dimensions needed

**Scenario 3: Weak/No Correlation (r < 0.3 or p > 0.05)**  
❌ **Challenge NPS validity** in healthcare  
❌ Redirect to NLP-based alternatives  
❌ Capture nuanced emotional/experiential data

### Software Design Flow (ICT R&D Framework)

The research follows evidence-based system design principles (Wohlin & Runeson, 2021):

1. **Data Import Layer:** CSV ingestion with validation
2. **Cleaning Pipeline:** Pandas-based transformation with logging
3. **Aggregation Engine:** Clinic-month grouping with temporal features
4. **Statistical Module:** Correlation + Regression + Clustering
5. **Visualization Layer:** Interactive Streamlit dashboard
6. **Export Module:** Results, visualizations, reports

from scipy.stats import pearsonr, spearmanr
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load cleaned dataset
df = pd.read_csv('data/processed/clinic_nps_revenue.csv')

# Aggregate by clinic-month

## 💡 Key Takeaways

**For Researchers:**  
This study demonstrates how ICT R&D methodologies can bridge academic rigor with real-world business problems. Quantitative validation isn't just about proving correlations — it's about building evidence-based foundations for future AI systems.

**For Healthcare Professionals:**  
Before investing $50K+ annually in patient feedback systems, ask one question: *"Has anyone proven this metric predicts what I care about?"* This research provides that validation framework.

**For Software Engineers:**  
Data science isn't just about building models — it's about asking the right questions first. This research journey shows how critical literature review, methodological rigor, and statistical validation create the foundation for truly intelligent systems.
