# Notes for REM502

## Module 1 - Introduction to Research Methodologies and Research Topic

First step for a research is defining the problem we want to address.

Essential Rules:
originallity - how unique does the topic needs to be?
topic restrictions - which topics are allowed?
data requirements - primary, secondary or both?
methodology - qualitative, quantitative or mixed?
ethics - what are restrictions and requirements?

identify areas that interest you and then narrow it down to a specific topic.

## Takeways:
- Identify 3-4 broad interest areas
- Find 2-3 articles related to each of the interest areas
- Share with Lecturer for validation

## Questions for Dr. Bushra Naeem:
1) so the idea is that I identify areas of interest, do some research on them, try to narrow down a few paths and share with you, so you'll be able to guide me?
Take advantage of the opportunity to study something of pure interest and think on mid-long term goals tied to my future career and pathway here in Australia, earning that masters degree, PR, new job opporunities, opening opportunity for Doctoral or studies.
> R: Exactly

2) Do you have any interesting cases that you could share?
> R: Broad topic: "Impact of Social Media on Education"
> Refined problem: "How does daily use of social media affect student academic performance in Australian universities?"

- prepare data to cross nps x sales kpis

## Module 5 - Quantitative Research vs Qualitative Research

Quantitative 
Reporting results: 
narratives and quotes on the 

mixed-methods design: do we need to define the path we want to take?

Common research design mistakes:
- misaligned methods
- weak sampling
- ignoring ethics or validity

## Module 6 - Mixed Method Research
Use mixed-methods research when your quantitative data is insufficient on its own to answer your research question, as it allows you to both test and explore a topic. If you can answer your question with numbers alone, a purely quantitative approach is fine. Use mixed methods if you need to combine broad trends (quantitative) with rich context and "why" explanations (qualitative).
