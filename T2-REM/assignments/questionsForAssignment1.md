# Questions to check with Dr. Naeem

## Topic #1 - **Literature Depth**
- I have six core themes in the review (emotions, sentiment analysis, patient experience, NPS, AI frameworks, business perspectives). 
Do you think this balance is right, or should I cut/add a theme?
- How many peer-reviewed sources would you consider “safe” for aiming beyond the minimum (e.g., to target a Distinction/HD)?

## Topic 2 - **Critical Analysis vs Description**
- I’ve included critique (e.g., limitations of NPS, lack of healthcare-specific studies). Do you think my review is sufficiently critical, or should I push harder on comparing/contrasting sources?
- Would you recommend I add a short “theoretical lens” (like service quality frameworks or AI adoption models), or keep it strictly literature-based?

## Topic 3 - **Ethics & Alignment with Rubric**
- The rubric mentions ethical principles (SLO e). Would including a small section on privacy and anonymization of patient comments be enough, or should ethics play a bigger role in the literature review?

## Topic 4 - **Research Gap & Question**
- Does my stated research gap clearly justify the move from traditional metrics (NPS) to AI sentiment analysis in healthcare, or do I need to sharpen it further?
- Is my proposed research question too broad (“Can AI-driven sentiment analysis enhance predictive value…”) or should I phrase it more narrowly for Assessment 1?

## Topic 5 - **Strategic Alignment**
Since this is a foundation for Assessment 2 and 3, are there adjustments I can make now that will set me up for success in those later tasks (e.g., methodology or proposal structure)?
