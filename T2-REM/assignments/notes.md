# My Notes for the Assignments of Research Methodologies

## Assessment 1
### Assessment 1 Brief: **Briefing** 
Assessment: Critical Literature Review
Length: 1,500 words
Due Date: 12/10/2025

#### Summary: 
This assessment task is designed to enhance your skills to critically assess the studies that have been conducted on your research topic and to synthesise the findings in a coherent manner. You will write a critical literature review, which is the base for and will lead towards defining your Research Proposal (Assessment 3). This assessment task is the beginning step of your research design and will play an important role in carrying out your research.

#### Context:
Research is an iterative process. The abstract, research statement, research gaps, research question(s), aims and objectives may well change depending on what is discovered during your literature search, the methodologies chosen and proposed methods. Feedback from the Learning Facilitator will also help you refine these elements.

The purpose of a literature review is to gain an understanding of the existing body of research, current industry ICT trends and debates relevant to a particular topic or area of study. It involves the presentation of the accumulated knowledge in the form of a summary and a critical evaluation of the sources accessed. This summary presents an analysis of the points presented in academic and/or professional sources and an evaluation of their strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, by conducting a literature review, you can acquire knowledge about the foundational and important concepts, research methods, and experimental techniques used in your relevant field
of study. You also gain an insight into how researchers apply the concepts learnt in the course to real world problems. Another great benefit of producing a literature review is that, as you progress in your writing of it, you develop a better understanding of how research findings are presented and discussed in your discipline of study. In addition, conducting a literature review helps to strengthen the currency of the knowledge-base in a given field of study.

For this assessment task, you must produce a critical Literature Review. This task isformative in nature and is the starting point in working towards your final Research Proposal (Assessment task 3). Each assessment task in this subject is designed to build your proficiency level in research methodologies and is not a stand-alone task. 

The Critical Literature Review is designed to provide academic substantiation and methodology rationale to your Assessment 3 Research Proposal—a report and presentation you will deliver in Week 12.

#### Instructions:
Write a critical literature review—an analysis and evaluation of published and unpublished materials which helps establish the current challenges and issues related to the topic under study. It should provide the reader with an overview of the research that has been already carried out on the topic and what challenges are yet to be overcome. It will also help identify research gaps.
You should address the following:
- Point out gaps in the literature or identify problems / issues to be solved.
- Highlight key issues essential to your ICT research.
- Summarise relevant academic/ professional resources and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses to demonstrate your critical understanding of the literature.
- Demonstrate that your research is rigorous and up-to-date by engaging with seminal and current work.

Guidelines to carry out a critical literature review:
- Browse discipline specific or area specific recent papers from reputable sources (academic and professional). (Note: 80% of the papers reviewed must be credible and reputable)
- Current sources published within the last 5 years are the best ones to consider since they reflect the newest discoveries and help avoid duplication of work, theories, processes, or best practices.
- A minimum of 8 recently published peer-reviewed sources including journal articles, books, and conference papers are to be considered. (Note: 80% of the papers reviewed must be journal articles, books, and conference papers)
- Refer to the library website to search for sources: https://library.torrens.edu.au/home
- On the left-hand side, go to the “All databases” link and, once there, use the Popular Databases on the right-hand side. These links give you access to peer-reviewed papers that you may use in addition to those that you can locate in the main search area.
- Avoid using online blogs and non-peer-reviewed sources. Edited books are a good source of information because they have undergone an editorial process.
- Detailed commentary on the analysis and critical evaluation presenting the strengths and weaknesses of the work must be provided for every resource. DO NOT JUST CUT AND PASTE THE ABSTRACT. You need to summarize the key findings from the papers, add their interpretations where appropriate, and emphasize the significance of their findings in relation to your topic.
- The APA 7th referencing style guidelines should be used for both in-text referencing as well as the reference list.

Remember, the literature review is part of the research process. Like data collection and analysis, it should be systematic and thorough.

This assessment task will later form part of the introduction of your final Research Proposal (Assessment task 3). The proposal may change depending on what is found in the literature search, and as the most suitable methodology is chosen.

#### Referencing
It is essential that you use appropriate APA style for citing and referencing research.

## Assessment 2
### Assessment 2 Brief: **Briefing** 
Assessment: Research Tools and Methodologies
Length: 1,500 words
Due Date: 09/11/2025

#### Summary: 
You will need to write a report. This assessment task is designed to help determine the research methodology and, subsequently, the research tools needed, based on the literature review that you have conducted in Assessment Task 1. The focus of this Assessment Task 2 here is on a comparative analysis of research methodologies that will assist you in preparing your final assessment—Assessment Task 3, your Research Proposal.

#### Context:
This assessment task, a report on Research Methodologies and Tools is formative in nature and constitutes the second stage in your work towards your final Research Proposal (Assessment Task 3). Each assessment task in this subject is designed to build competency in research methodologies and, as such, are not stand-alone assessment tasks. Assessment task 2 is designed to help you decide on the research methodologies that are appropriate for you to conduct your research.

This assessment task requires you, as a Software Engineering or an Information
Technology (IT) student, to research and prepare a comparative analysis of the
different research methodologies available depending on the nature of research that you wish to embark on, i.e., academic or industry-based research. Accordingly, you will have to consider either academic or industry (IT)-based research methodologies. Therefore, the methodologies, such as qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods, design science or prototyping, should be analysed to determine what would be the best approach for your Research Proposal (Assessment 3 in Week 12). Once you have determined the methodological approach that you wish to follow, you will need to decide on the types of research tools that you will need. Research instruments (or tools) may include surveys, questionnaires, interviews, focus groups, and quantitative
statistical analysis, among others. For example, if you plan to use a survey, a
questionnaire or an interview, you need to write the specific questions that you intend to ask and describe the data analysis method that you will apply to the responses that you will collect. Please include the questionnaire in the Appendix.

#### Instructions:
The Comparative Analysis Report is an individual assessment and accounts for 30% of your overall grade in this subject. Your report should have a word count of 1,500 words (+/-10%) including the following key elements:

1. The structure and contents of the Assessment task 2 is as follows:
- The title of your research
- Research questions (Modified version based on Assessment 1 feedback). Aims and objectives (Modified version based on Assessment 1 feedback).
- Comparative Analysis of research methodologies.
- Proposed methodology and research methods.
- Rationale for the choice of research method
- Ethical consideration.
- Data analysis strategies and tools.
- References.
- Appendices (if applicable).

2. To undertake comparative analysis of research methodologies, you need to consider an analytical approach to evaluate qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research methodologies. Outline the strengths andweaknesses of each approach in relation to your proposed research project.
What steps does each approach utilise? What are the limitations associated with each approach? Justify why the approach is still selected despite the limitations.

3. To propose a methodology for your research project, based on the analysis
conducted as step 2 above, you need to determine which research
methodology (i. e., qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods) is appropriate
for your research project. Discuss the reasons behind your choice of
methodology. Outline the software design, relate the methodologies and
methods to the research question(s). Indicate the following points:
- a. What methods are being used to address the research question(s)?
- b. What tools/research instruments are you planning on using?
- c. How do you plan on triangulating the data that you will collect?
- d. What ethical issues need to be taken into consideration?
- e. How have ethical considerations influenced the development of your research tools?

Note that the terms used in the steps listed above are defined as follows:
- **Methodology** is a systematic examination of the methods applied to any research field. It may be comprised of a system of methods designed to achieve the research outcome.
- **Methods** are the particular tools/research instruments that are intended for being used. (e.g., qualitative interviews, or quantitative statistical analysis).
- **Ethics** is an important issue when developing specific research tools, particularly when conducting research involving humans.

4. Appendices: You need to include any tools/research instruments that you have developed in this section. Please use different appendices (e.g., Appendix A, Appendix B) for different instruments. Appendices do NOT count towards your report’s word count.
