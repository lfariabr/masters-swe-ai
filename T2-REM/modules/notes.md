## Module 1 - Introduction to Research Methodologies and Research Topic

First step for a research is defining the problem we want to address.

Essential Rules:
originallity - how unique does the topic needs to be?
topic restrictions - which topics are allowed?
data requirements - primary, secondary or both?
methodology - qualitative, quantitative or mixed?
ethics - what are restrictions and requirements?

identify areas that interest you and then narrow it down to a specific topic.

## Takeways:
- Identify 3-4 broad interest areas
- Find 2-3 articles related to each of the interest areas
- Share with Lecturer for validation

## Questions for Dr. Bushra Naeem:
1) so the idea is that I identify areas of interest, do some research on them, try to narrow down a few paths and share with you, so you'll be able to guide me?
Take advantage of the opportunity to study something of pure interest and think on mid-long term goals tied to my future career and pathway here in Australia, earning that masters degree, PR, new job opporunities, opening opportunity for Doctoral or studies.
> R: Exactly

2) do you have any interesting cases that you could share?
> R: ... ?
Broad topic: "Impact of Social Media on Education"
Refined problem: "How does daily use of social media affect student academic performance in Australian universities?"
