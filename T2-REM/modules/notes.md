# Notes for REM502

## Module 1 - Introduction to Research Methodologies and Research Topic

First step for a research is defining the problem we want to address.

Essential Rules:
originallity - how unique does the topic needs to be?
topic restrictions - which topics are allowed?
data requirements - primary, secondary or both?
methodology - qualitative, quantitative or mixed?
ethics - what are restrictions and requirements?

identify areas that interest you and then narrow it down to a specific topic.

## Takeways:
- Identify 3-4 broad interest areas
- Find 2-3 articles related to each of the interest areas
- Share with Lecturer for validation

## Questions for Dr. Bushra Naeem:
1) so the idea is that I identify areas of interest, do some research on them, try to narrow down a few paths and share with you, so you'll be able to guide me?
Take advantage of the opportunity to study something of pure interest and think on mid-long term goals tied to my future career and pathway here in Australia, earning that masters degree, PR, new job opporunities, opening opportunity for Doctoral or studies.
> R: Exactly

2) Do you have any interesting cases that you could share?
> R: Broad topic: "Impact of Social Media on Education"
> Refined problem: "How does daily use of social media affect student academic performance in Australian universities?"

## Module 5 - Quantitative Research vs Qualitative Research

1. Quantitative Research: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHpf5V1SpNc
This 8-minute video provides an introduction to quantitative research methodologies. By watching this video, you will learn about the characteristics of quantitative research, the types of data used, and how to design and conduct quantitative research studies. This knowledge is important in order to conduct research in many fields and can help you develop effective research questions, select appropriate data collection methods, and analyse data appropriately.

2. 4 Types of Quantitative Research: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dokZ5HSYZIA
By watching this video, you will learn about the four main types of quantitative research designs, namely, descriptive, correlational, quasi-experimental, and experimental. By the end of the video, you will understand the purpose and appropriate use of each type of research, as well as the strengths and limitations of each approach. This knowledge is essential in order to conduct effective research in a variety of fields, from psychology to business to ICT. The video is approximately 4 minutes long. If you are planning to use quantitative research methods for your assessment tasks, this and the resource included above will be invaluable.

3. Qualitative Research Methods: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV3xspoR4gA
This resource is a video presentation on qualitative research methods. It introduces the basics of qualitative research and how it differs from quantitative research. By watching the video, you will learn about the key concepts and principles of qualitative research, including its various data collection methods, data analysis techniques and ethical considerations. This knowledge is essential for anyone conducting research in any field that relies on understanding human behaviour and experiences. The video has a duration of approximately 34 minutes.

4. 5 Types of Qualitative Research: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H45UCgcfLC8
This short resource covers the five types of qualitative research and their applications in the field of research and development (R&D) in the ICT sector. You will learn about the five types of qualitative research methods, namely, ethnography, case studies, grounded theory, phenomenology and narrative research. You will also gain insights into how these research methods can be used to explore research questions and solve problems in the ICT sector. Having knowledge of qualitative research methodologies is important if you are interested in pursuing a career in ICT, especially in R&D, as it can enhance your ability to gather and analyse data effectively.

5. Quantitative Data Analysis: https://doi.org/10.4135/9781544316499
In the following chapter, the author discusses a range of quantitative data analysis techniques that you may want to consider for application in your research project. The author also discusses various tools and frameworks available for you to utilise for your research project. Please read the chapter to gain an understanding about the tools and techniques that you could use in the quantitative data analysis section of your project.

6. Qualitative vs Quantitative Research Explained: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzN_HgBK2uQ
After having acquired a good understanding of both the quantitative and qualitative research methods, it is time to look at various differences between the two and what criteria are used to choose each of them. In the following video, the speaker, after providing an introduction of the qualitative and quantitative research method, discusses the selection criteria and provides a comparison between the two methods. Please watch the video since it will help you decide on the suitable research methodology for your research project.
