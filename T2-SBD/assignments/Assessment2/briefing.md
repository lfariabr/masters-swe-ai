## Assessment 2
### Assessment 2 Brief: **Briefing** 
Assessment: Case Study
Length: 3,000 words
Due Date: 09/11/2025

#### Summary: 
Create a document that advises on how to create a complete cyber security environment in an enterprise. Critically analyse the basic requirements in conjunction with available technical and organizational cyber security methods and align them with adequate user experience. This has to be aligned with relevant industry or international standards, such as OWASP or ISO270xx.
Please refer to the Instructions for details on how to complete this task.

#### Context:
Security (and the maintenance of security) is an issue that many companies have to consider in order to protect both corporate and user data, assets, and other general information. Breaches of this security have happened in the past, at many different levels. A breach often has many effects, affecting both the consumer and the company.

The report you produce will assess your understanding and ability to create a secure IT environment that is manageable and provides the actual users with as less burden as possible while maintaining the highest security standard possible.

**Scenario**
Consider you being the member of the CISO-Team (Chief Information Security Officer Team) of an enterprise with approx. 300 employees. The business of this
company is:
- performing data analysis for hospitals (i.e. how many diagnosises of what type)
- performing data analysis for retailers (i.e. how many products of what type). 
This data contains no personal data from shoppers such as credit cards.

In both instances the data is provided by the respective client. All clients and all client data is from Australia only.
Because of the sensitive nature of the hospital data, the data is stored on premise while the retail data, because of sheer size, is stored in a cloud storage. The cloud provider fulfills all necessary security standards and resides in Australia.
About 100 staff is working with the hospital data, this group is called “Doctors” and 200 with the retail data, group called “Retailers”.
Every group is organised into a “support”-team, consisting of personal assistants, group head and group vice head and then the analysts. Every 20 analysts work on the same client, there is no one working on two or more clients’ data.
The software that is being used for both groups is capable of having individual usernames and group roles. Access control for data can be set by username, group or both.
The executives of the company (CEO, CFO and CMO) as well as their PA should not have any access to the data, the IT staff only when required for troubleshooting the application or storage.

#### Instructions
You will be asked to write a design guide how to create a secure environment for the enterprise since the client demand information about the safety of their data. This includes addressing the following topics:

- What kind of user training is required and explain why this suggested training is required to achieve a better cyber security?
- Perform a risk assessment to identify at least 5 major risks?
- What technical and/or organisational methods can be deployed to mitigate assessed risks? Name at least four technical and two organisational methods and indicate on how to deploy them. Describe the impact on the users ability to work for each method.
- If applicable identify mandatory methods out of the list created.
- Describe if user groups and user rights need to be implemented in the
    - analysis application and
    - the basic IT system (E-Mail, PC-Login etc.)
- Create an appropriate password rule for user accounts both in the application and for general IT and administration accounts (administrator, root, etc.). Explain why you chose this rule or those rules and align that with current standards (such as NIST)
- Define the required security measures for the storage and align them with current standards
- A recommendation for a plan of action for creating and maintaining proper information security.
- A recommendation for a plan to sustain business availabilities.
- A reference to relevant security and governance standards.
- A brief discussion on service quality vs security assurance trade-off (less than 500 words).

You will be assessed on the justification and understanding of security methods, as well as how well your recommendations follow Secure by Design principles, and how well they are argued. The quality of your research will also be assessed, you may include references relating to the case, as well as non-academic references. You need to follow the relevant standards and reference them. If you chose to not follow a standard a detailed explanation of why not is required.
The content of the outlined chapters/books and discussion with the lecturer in
the modules 1 – 12 should be reviewed. Further search in the library and/or internet about the relevant topic is requested as well.

#### Referencing
Referencing is essential for this assessment. A minimum of one reference for each topic is required for this, including at least 8 academic sources or relevant standards.

(An academic source is one that has been peer-reviewed).

Your references will be evaluated for their relevance to the case study.
Remember you must ensure that your arguments and justifications are based on sound reasoning and clear relevance. Ensure that you reference according to the appropriate APA style, for citing and referencing information, as well as all appropriate research sources.
