## Assessment 2
### Assessment 2 Brief: **Briefing** 
Assessment: Case Study
Length: 3,000 words
Due Date: 09/11/2025

#### Summary: 
Create a document that advises on how to create a complete cyber security environment in an enterprise. Critically analyse the basic requirements in conjunction with available technical and organizational cyber security methods and align them with adequate user experience. This has to be aligned with relevant industry or international standards, such as OWASP or ISO270xx.
Please refer to the Instructions for details on how to complete this task.

#### Context:
Security (and the maintenance of security) is an issue that many companies
have to consider in order to protect both corporate and user data, assets, and
other general information. Breaches of this security have happened in the past,
at many different levels. A breach often has many effects, affecting both the
consumer and the company.

The report you produce will assess your understanding and ability to create a
secure IT environment that is manageable and provides the actual users with as
less burden as possible while maintaining the highest security standard possible.

**Scenario**
Consider you being the member of the CISO-Team (Chief Information Security
Officer Team) of an enterprise with approx. 300 employees. The business of this
company is:
- performing data analysis for hospitals (i.e. how many diagnosises of what type)
- performing data analysis for retailers (i.e. how many products of what
type). This data contains no personal data from shoppers such as credit
cards.

In both instances the data is provided by the respective client. All clients and all client data is from Australia only.
Because of the sensitive nature of the hospital data, the data is stored on premise while the retail data, because of sheer size, is stored in a cloud storage. The cloud provider fulfills all necessary security standards and resides in Australia.
About 100 staff is working with the hospital data, this group is called “Doctors” and 200 with the retail data, group called “Retailers”.
Every group is organised into a “support”-team, consisting of personal assistants, group head and group vice head and then the analysts. Every 20 analysts work on the same client, there is no one working on two or more clients’ data.
The software that is being used for both groups is capable of having individual usernames and group roles. Access control for data can be set by username, group or both.
The executives of the company (CEO, CFO and CMO) as well as their PA should not have any access to the data, the IT staff only when required for troubleshooting the application or storage.

#### Instructions
You will be asked to write a design guide how to create a secure environment for the enterprise since the client demand information about the safety of their data. This includes addressing the following topics:

- What kind of user training is required and explain why this suggested
training is required to achieve a better cyber security?
- Perform a risk assessment to identify at least 5 major risks?
- What technical and/or organisational methods can be deployed to mitigate
assessed risks? Name at least four technical and two organisational
methods and indicate on how to deploy them. Describe the impact on the
users ability to work for each method.
- If applicable identify mandatory methods out of the list created.
- Describe if user groups and user rights need to be implemented in the
    - analysis application and
    - the basic IT system (E-Mail, PC-Login etc.)
- Create an appropriate password rule for user accounts both in the
application and for general IT and administration accounts (administrator,
root, etc.). Explain why you chose this rule or those rules and align that
with current standards (such as NIST)
- Define the required security measures for the storage and align them with
current standards
- A recommendation for a plan of action for creating and maintaining proper
information security.
- A recommendation for a plan to sustain business availabilities.
- A reference to relevant security and governance standards.
- A brief discussion on service quality vs security assurance trade-off (less than 500 words).

You will be assessed on the justification and understanding of security methods, as well as how well your recommendations follow Secure by Design principles, and how well they are argued. The quality of your research will also be assessed, you may include references relating to the case, as well as non-academic references. You need to follow the relevant standards and reference them. If you chose to not follow a standard a detailed explanation of why not is required.
The content of the outlined chapters/books and discussion with the lecturer in
the modules 1 – 12 should be reviewed. Further search in the library and/or internet about the relevant topic is requested as well.

#### Referencing
Referencing is essential for this assessment. A minimum of one reference for
each topic is required for this, including at least 8 academic sources or relevant standards.

(An academic source is one that has been peer-reviewed).

Your references will be evaluated for their relevance to the case study.
Remember you must ensure that your arguments and justifications are based on sound reasoning and clear relevance.
Ensure that you reference according to the appropriate APA style, for citing and referencing information, as well as all appropriate research sources.

## Assessment 3
### Assessment 3 Brief: **Briefing** 
Assessment: Case Study Project
Length: 1,500 words + 4-6 minutes presentation with a poster
Due Date: 03/12/2025

#### Summary: 
Cyber Security relies on well designed and implemented systems and
applications. It is a crucial task to create a design document that addresses not only the desired technical features but all security related constraints and design systems. If such a design document lacks clarity and completeness, the resulting implementation is very likely flawed and creates a security risk.

#### Instructions: 
You are tasked to create a security design guide for a web based data retrieval
application. This design guide must include all required security measures, their references to applicable standards (i.e. OWASP, ISO 27001) and the specification of technical methods, such as encryption algorithms or encrypted data transport. 
It is not necessary to include technical details on how the system should be coded or how the GUI design should look like. The guide must concentrate on the security aspects of the application. 

The application is divided into three parts; Request, Retrieve and Review

**Part 1: Request**

**Scenario:**
Consider a web interface where a user can log into and then request data from a
database. The web interface incorporates a login page accessible by a login-
button. After a successful login the web interface for the data retrieval is
accessible and the interface displays a search field(s) that directly create a SQL query to the database with the information stored (your instructor may
demonstrate such an example, as required). The returned information is then
displayed as a result to the user.

The data fields on the web interface may include:
- Name
- Address (separate field for unit, street, postal code, state, suburb)
- Phone number

Wildcard searches are often permitted for ‘Name’ and ‘Phone number’ for user
convenience.

**Task**
You must create a security design specification (not a GUI layout or coding) that
specifies how the individual fields of the web interface shall be sized and
evaluated. It is also required to specify the method of transporting the data from he web interface to the backend (web and database systems) and how the user
authentication shall be performed. It must be specified where the login
credentials are stored, how they are stored and what happens if a user tries to
login with the wrong credentials. References to relevant standards or reasoning
why a specific standard is not being followed is required

**Part 2: Retrieve**

**Scenario:**
Consider an SQL-based database as a case example (note you are not expected
to produce SQL codes and a sample database may be demonstrated by your
instructor, if required). This database contains all retrievable data and shall only
be accessible when a user is successfully logged in. The data stored in the
database consists of:
- Name (last name is sufficient)
- Address (separate entries for unit, street, postal code, state, suburb)
- Phone number
- Medical status with one of the following possible entries:
    - Sick
    - Healthy
    - Cancer
    - Deceased
    - Flu
    - Covid
- Credit card data (credit card number and expiry stored as separate fields)

For simplicity, all fields can be formatted as strings.

**Task:**
In the design document it is mandatory that the appropriate field length is
chosen with a detailed explanation of why this length is chosen. It is also
mandatory that database security related issues are addressed such as SQL-
escaping. Special knowledge of SQL-Databases is not required, you must
describe your design choices in plain English. References to relevant standards
or reasoning why a specific standard is not being followed is required.

**Part 3: Review**

**Scenario:**
A user rights model should exist that permits which user (group) is allowed to
see what kind of data. Generally three groups of users must exist:
1. Normal user that only shall see name and address and phone number from the database
2. Accounting users that can see name, address, phone number and credit card data from the database and
3. Privileged users that can see all data

**Task:**
The design paper has to address how to identify those users and how to create the individual access rights into the database. Again, it is not requested that you know the actual database programming. Description of the required user roles and general system design is adequate.

Generally, this design paper shall be created with the security concept in mind
and not with the technical details. The paper must include the following topics:
- Handling of data input with an explanation for why this form or method is
being used
- Prevention of malicious data input
- Prevention of login trials with incorrect credentials by a robot
- The secure storing and retrieving of account credentials
- The rights model and prevention of gaining unwanted rights
- General security designs
- General risk assessment of applications of that type

If encryption algorithms or any other method for ensuring security is required, a detailed specification of that is mandatory. Detailed specification includes possible algorithms and minimum keylength.
If a requirement from one part is needed in another part this must be reflected in the description of the other part, i.e. if the web page requires a secured field in the database this must be described in the database part.
The student shall present their solution(s) with a one-page poster and a 4-6
minutes presentation about the solution.

As preparation, please review all material provided and discussed during the
modules 1 – 8. Additional individual research in the library and on the internet is recommended.

> Hint: It is a good idea to research the topic of “SQL code injection”.
> Hint: If access to the database is defined to require database credentials (username and password), the handling of these credentials in the database itself is not a required part of the assignment.

#### Applicable standards
The report must include references to applicable standards or industry good practises where appropriate. It is mandatory that the chosen design is compared to the relevant standards and, where it is divergent, to be explained why the standard is not followed.

#### Referencing
Referencing is essential for this assessment. A minimum of one reference for
each topic is required for this, including at least 8 academic sources.

(An academic source is one that has been peer-reviewed).

Your references will be evaluated for their relevance to the case study.
Remember you must ensure that your arguments and justifications are based on
sound reasoning and clear relevance.

Ensure that you reference according to the appropriate APA style, for
citing and referencing information, as well as all appropriate research
sources.
