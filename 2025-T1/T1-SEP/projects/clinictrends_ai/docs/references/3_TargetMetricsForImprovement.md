# Document Target Metrics for Improvement

To enhance our 80% accuracy on the 30K+ NPS dataset for the aesthetic clinic, we need targeted metrics that address industry-specific challenges (e.g., procedure satisfaction, online reputation). Here are the proposed targets:

- **Accuracy**: Aim for 85-90% by fine-tuning on aesthetic clinic data (e.g., feedback on Botox, fillers) and addressing class imbalance. The current 80% is solid, but higher stakes in cosmetic outcomes justify this stretch goal.

- **Precision/Recall**: Target 80%+ for each class (promoters, passives, detractors) to ensure balanced performance. Detractors (e.g., dissatisfied with results) are critical in aesthetic clinics, where one negative review can deter clients, per 2023 Drive Research data (43% of millennials switch practices).

- **F1-Score**: Goal of 0.85+ to balance precision and recall, reflecting reliable prediction across diverse sentiments (e.g., neutral feedback on wait times vs. strong opinions on outcomes).

- **Dataset Expansion**: Increase to 40K-50K records by including external aesthetic clinic reviews (e.g., RealSelf) or longitudinal patient data, improving generalization. Current 30K may miss niche demographics (e.g., high-income clients).

- **Response Rate Impact**: Monitor survey fatigue, a 2025 trend, and aim for a 70%+ response rate by optimizing mobile-friendly, post-procedure surveys (e.g., via apps), leveraging Viseven’s insight on mobile accessibility.

**Critical Consideration**: The +58 healthcare NPS average may not apply to aesthetic clinics, where patient expectations (e.g., flawless results) are higher, potentially lowering achievable scores. Targets should account for this by prioritizing detractor reduction (e.g., addressing 60% negative experiences noted by SurveyMonkey). Real-time feedback loops (e.g., post-treatment surveys) could also refine metrics, aligning with Relias’ emphasis on immediate data capture.

> Notes: These sources support targets like 80%+ precision/recall and real-time feedback, but the +58 healthcare average may not suit aesthetic clinics where detractor impact (e.g., 43% millennial turnover) is higher. The emphasis on mobile surveys aligns with 2025 trends but lacks clinic-specific validation.
