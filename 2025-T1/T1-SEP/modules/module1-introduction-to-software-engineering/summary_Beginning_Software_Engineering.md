# Beginning Software Engineering – Chapter 1  
*(Rod Stephens, 2015)*

This chapter provides a bird’s-eye view of the Software Engineering Lifecycle. Stephens stresses that software engineering is not merely about writing code—it’s a disciplined process aimed at delivering reliable and maintainable systems.

## 🔑 Key Points:

- **Software Engineering ≠ Programming**: SE is the application of engineering principles to software. It involves design, analysis, testing, and maintenance beyond just coding.

- **Phases of SDLC**:
  - **Requirements Gathering**: The cornerstone of a successful system. Misunderstanding user needs leads to failure.
  - **Design**: Involves choosing the right architecture (2-tier, 3-tier, etc.), data structures, and interaction flow.
  - **Implementation**: Actual coding happens here. Emphasizes modularity and documentation.
  - **Testing**: Vital to ensure that the system meets user expectations and is free of bugs.
  - **Deployment & Maintenance**: Software evolves post-deployment. Good engineering allows for iteration.

## 🔍 Relevance to ClinicTrendsAI:

As ClinicTrendsAI incorporates machine learning predictions and dashboards, a clear requirements and design phase ensures that the solution is both user-friendly and scalable. Choosing Streamlit (frontend) and Python (backend) during design phase avoids mismatch later.
