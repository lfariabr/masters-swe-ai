# Queensland Health Payroll System Failure – Case Study Summary

## 🧾 Overview

The Queensland Health Payroll System project was intended to replace legacy payroll systems (LATTICE and ESP) with a modern SAP-based solution. Despite being initially budgeted at **AU$6.19 million**, it spiraled into one of the most expensive IT project failures in Australian history, ultimately costing **AU$1.25 billion**.

- **Client**: Queensland Health
- **Prime Contractor**: IBM Australia
- **Technology Stack**: SAP ECC5 and Workbrain
- **Go-Live**: March 2010
- **End Result**: Over 35,000 payroll errors and enormous public backlash.

## ❗ Key Takeaways

### 1. Procurement & Vendor Selection Failures
- IBM was appointed despite a flawed evaluation process.
- Inquiry concluded IBM should **never** have been selected.

### 2. Governance Breakdown
- Lack of single point accountability.
- Weak oversight by CorpTech and multiple scope changes.

### 3. Poor Change & Testing Management
- Inadequate user training and stakeholder communication.
- Critical categories (e.g., casuals and overtime) were **never tested** before launch.

### 4. System Complexity Ignored
- QH’s payroll was extremely complex (retrospectivity, concurrent jobs).
- SAP + Workbrain was not properly tailored.

### 5. Legal & Political Fallout
- Minister of Health resigned.
- IBM not held financially liable due to a 2010 agreement.
- Government lost the lawsuit in 2016.
