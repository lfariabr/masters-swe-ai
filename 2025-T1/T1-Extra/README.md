Welcome to my Extra Work done for the **Master's of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence** at **Torrens University**.

Inside, you'll find all the projects I tackled to sharpen and test my knowledge in a deep level of details.

I hope this setup offers helpful insights - and perhaps even inspires you to fork it or contribute!

### Why This Repository Was Born
- **Going Beyond the Curriculum**: This space documents the extra challenges I tackled outside of my core Master’s subjects to deepen my technical expertise and prepare for real-world engineering roles.
- **Practice with Purpose**: Each project here was selected to reinforce hands-on skills in backend/frontend development, cloud architecture, DevOps, and testing, aligned with top-tier software engineering standards.
- **From Theory to Market-Ready**: Building CI/CD pipelines, crafting scalable cloud systems or debugging cross-stack applications, these challenges are designed into marketable, job-ready skills.
