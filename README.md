Welcome to my personal repository for the **Master's of Software Engineering (Artificial Intelligence, Advanced)** at **Torrens University**.

Inside, you'll find my study notes, case studies, experiments, and practical projects in AI, machine learning and full-stack software development.  
Whether you're a fellow student, developer or simply curious about the field, I hope this repo offers helpful insights—and perhaps even inspires you to fork it or contribute!

### Program Overview
This repo serves as both my personal knowledge base and project portfolio during my Master's. I’m capturing my learning process, practical applications of course concepts, and projects that reflect my interests in software engineering and AI.

### My Approach
- **Learning by Doing**: Practical implementation of theoretical concepts
- **Documentation First**: Maintaining clear, structured notes and documentation
- **Real-world focus**: Marketable skills and practical solutions
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular updates and refinements to projects and notes

### Current Term: T1
#### T1: Software Development Management
- [Course Materials](./T1-Software-Development-Management/)
- [README](./T1-Software-Development-Management/README.md)

#### T1: Software Engineering Principles
- [Course Materials](./T1-Software-Engineering-Principles/)
- [README](./T1-Software-Engineering-Principles/README.md)
