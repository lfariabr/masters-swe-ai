## Program Overview
This repository serves as my personal knowledge base and project portfolio while pursuing my Masters in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. Here, I document my learning journey, projects, and practical applications of the concepts I'm studying.

## My Approach
- **Learning by Doing**: Practical implementation of theoretical concepts
- **Documentation First**: Maintaining clear, structured notes and documentation
- **Real-world Application**: Focusing on marketable skills and practical solutions
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular updates and refinements to projects and notes

## Current Term: T1
### T1: Software Development Management
- [Course Materials](./T1-Software-Development-Management/)
- [README](./T1-Software-Development-Management/README.md)

### T1: Software Engineering Principles
- [Course Materials](./T1-Software-Engineering-Principles/)
