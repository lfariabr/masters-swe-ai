Welcome to my personal repo for the **Master's of Software Engineering (Artificial Intelligence, Advanced)** at **Torrens University**.

Inside, you'll find my study notes, case studies, experiments, and practical projects in AI, machine learning and full-stack software development.  

Whether you're a fellow student, developer or simply curious about the field, I hope this setup offers helpful insights - and perhaps even inspires you to fork it or contribute!

### My Approach
- **Learning by Doing**: Practical implementation of theoretical concepts
- **Documentation First**: Maintaining clear, structured notes and documentation
- **Real-world focus**: Marketable skills and practical solutions
- **Continuous Improvement**: Daily updates and refinements to projects and notes
