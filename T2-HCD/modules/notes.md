Key principles:
user-centred - goals, preferences, and goals of end-users
hollistic - considers broader context in which design will be used
sustainable - minimize negative imapct and maximize positive impact
iterative - continuous process of testing and learning

## Questions for Dr. Omid Haass:
1. Assessment #2 - Adoption of new techologies and the impact it has on society: should we do it following up assessment #1?
> R: Up to us... it can either be the same or different. Dr. Omid suggests to do it different (maybe FDS, Tesla).
