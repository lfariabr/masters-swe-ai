## Assessment 2
### Assessment Brief 2: **Solution Report**

Assessment: Proposed Solution Report
Length: 2,000 words with supporting images
Due Date: 09/11/2025

#### Summary: 
Select a recent technology development (last 10 years) and discuss how an aspect of this tech may have undermined its social, global or cultural impact. Then, discuss possible alternative solutions to address these concerns. The report should be 2K words in length and is a preparation for Assessment 3, which involves fully developing or concepting one of the solutions you propose as part of this assessment.

#### Context:
All developed technologies come with inherent side effects. Whether recent developments - such as the internet, mobile phones, or artificial intelligence - or older creations - such as the internal combustion engine (ICE), many often cause unintended consequences. Fossil fuel usage alongside ICEs have contributed to widespread warming of our planet, and mobile phone introduction has led to fundamental changes in how society communicates and receives information.

This Proposed Solution Report aims to assess your understanding of the side effects of your chosen technology. A further aim is to determine your ability to evaluate, break down and categorise these side effects. Alongside your chosen technology and referenced resources, you will ideally demonstrate your understanding of these complex issues.

Some examples of topics you could cover include:
- The development of the aeroplane and its ability to connect individuals globally, but also its ability to cause health or safety issues through rapid spread of illness.
- The development of the Internet and its ability to connect individuals globally, and the issues it can cause - in particular with areas of illegal or dangerous activities.
- The development of firewalling technology in conjunction with the Internet, and how it is used to block access to parts of the internet in different regions.

The topic chosen should be addressed and evaluated in detail, and an examination of the severity level of the flow-on effects documented. It should also propose solutions to the flow-on effects caused by the technology’s implementation. Note that the result of the report can highlight existing solutions that exist, but should go further in presenting additional solutions.

Please note: Keep in mind the solutions you discuss at the end of your report may become further developed or explained as part of assessment 3.

#### Instructions:
This assessment requires you to investigate a technology developed in the past 10 years, and determine how an aspect of that technology has undermined its social, global or cultural impact. As part of this report, you will also discuss possible solutions. As part of the analysis component, you will write a report that focuses on the following areas:
- The development of the technology, and the main effects.
    - Did the technology, while in development, inspire anything else before release?
    - Was it an easy development process, or perhaps more ethically complicated?
- The release of the technology, and the immediate ‘undermining’ effect its release may have had.
    - How quickly did society identify the issues with the technology?
    - How long did issues take to appear?
- Long-term undermining effects.
    - How long did these take to appear?
    - How ingrained are they in society now?
    - What long-term adjustments or changes occurred?
    - Were there restrictions implemented for the technology’s usage or future development?

#### Referencing
Referencing is essential for this assignment. A minimum of **10-12 references** is required for this, including at least **eight academic sources**.
(An academic source is one that has been peer-reviewed, or cited in the past)

References are marked in relevance to ensure that your arguments and justifications draw on sound reasoning and clear relevance.

**Ensure that you reference according to the appropriate APA style, for citing and referencing information, as well as all appropriate research sources.**

It is essential that you use appropriate APA style for citing and referencing research. Please see more information on referencing here: http://library.laureate.net.au/research_skills_referencing
