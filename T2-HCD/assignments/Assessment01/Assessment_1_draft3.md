# Assessment 1 Draft 3

- Technology = AI Recommender Systems
- Application/Case = TikTok (and Reels/Shorts as comparisons)

## Slide 1 – Title

AI Recommender Systems: Moral & Ethical Impact and Immediate Effects
Case study: TikTok and short-form video platforms + Twitter and short-text platforms

⸻

## Slide 2 – The Technology

What are AI Recommender Systems?
- Machine learning algorithms → personalize content feeds.
- Use user data (watch time, likes, comments) to optimize predictions.
- Accessibility: simplifies discovery, removes need to search.

(Visual: simple diagram of input → algorithm → personalized feed)

⸻

## Slide 3 – Human-Centered Design Lens
- Norman’s Principles: visibility (clear feedback in feed), mapping (scroll = next video), feedback (likes/views).
- Affordances abused: infinite scroll = addictive loop.
- Gee’s Guidelines: stimulation yes, ergonomics & wellbeing neglected.

⸻

## Slide 4 – Moral Lens (Wellbeing & Addiction)
- Problematic TikTok Use (validated scales).
- Short-form linked to attention span reduction.
- WHO: sedentary guidelines → higher screen time ↔ obesity risk.

⸻

## Slide 5 – Ethical Lens (Governance & Data)
- EU fines for data/privacy violations.
- Algorithm opacity → filter bubbles, misinformation.
- Global bans on government devices (trust issue).

⸻

## Slide 6 – Immediate Effects
- 1B+ adoption: content discovery without search.
- Changed knowledge flows: “micro-learning” formats.
- Industry response: Reels, Shorts, Fast Laughs all adopted the tech.

⸻

## Slide 7 – Societal Shifts
- New influencer economy.
- Meme culture dominance.
- Commerce: live shopping integrations.
- Negative: reduced face-to-face, sedentary lifestyles.

⸻

## Slide 8 – Long-Term Effects
- Positive: democratized creativity, cultural exchange.
- Negative: attention fragmentation, rising anxiety, global mistrust in platforms.
- Paradox of Technology (Norman): more power = more complexity/risks.

⸻

## Slide 9 – Design Recommendations
- Wellbeing by Default (time limits, prompts).
- Exposure Diversity (inject serendipity, diversity ## sliders).
- Data Dignity (transparent audits, parental dashboards, local storage).

⸻

## Slide 10 – Takeaways
- Recommender systems are the technology that drives TikTok’s success and controversy.
- They exemplify both human-centered design brilliance and ethical challenges.
- The future of HCD depends on designing algorithms for wellbeing, not just engagement.

### What Changes vs Your Original Deck
1.	Title/Focus → Swap “TikTok” for “AI Recommender Systems”. TikTok is now the case study, not the “technology.”
2.	Add Theory Slide → Bring Norman + Gee into the story earlier (Slide 3).
3.	Relabel Immediate & Long-Term Effects → Talk about recommender systems broadly, but use TikTok examples.
4.	Strengthen Industry Impact → Reels, Shorts, Fast Laughs as evidence of how the technology spread.
5.	Takeaways → Center on recommender systems shaping society, not just TikTok.
