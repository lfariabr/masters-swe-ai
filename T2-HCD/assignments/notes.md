# My Notes for the Assignments of Human Centered Design

## Assessment 1
### Assessment Brief 1: **Research Presentation** 
Assessment: Presentation, Evolution of Technology
Length: 8-10 minutes
Due Date: 12/10/2025

#### Summary: 
Develop a presentation to discuss contemporary technology that has become public in the last 30 years, examining 2 major areas:
1 - How it challenges the existing moral and ethical framework of society
2 - Immediate effects on human understanding and knowledge
Presentation should last roughly 8-10 minutes and display a clear understanding of contemporary technology chosen.

#### Context:
Technology has evolved and changed drastically throughout the past 30 years. The evolution of the Internet and personal computers has led to incredible advances in connectivity and communication. Some examples of the many different changes that have occurred include - mobile phone accessibility, online communities and the development of social media. For this assessment you will select an area that you find compelling, that you can examine in depth.

The presentation should demonstrate my understanding and ability to evaluate the impact on society of the chosen technological advance, both through a moralistic or ethical lens and through a progressive lens. With my selected example and supporting material, I will examine and discuss the technology and its impact on society as a whole.

#### Instructions:
1. Investigate a technology development from the past 30 years, of your own choosing.
2. You must then determine the effects on society, through a moral and/or ethical lens.
3. You must consider the direct progressive effects, from a technical perspective - what that development inspired within the industry.
4. You will then create a presentation that follows a basic structure that seeks to investigate three primary elements (bullet points below). Within the three primary elements you may wish to answer the following questions:
- The technology itself
    - Can you measure its accessibility?
    - What moral or ethical issues did the development process have?
- Immediate effects of the development
    - When it launched - or became available - what happened in the first few years?
    - Did society have any issues with adopting this technology? How severe were they?
    - What changed within society after it became available?
    - What technologies carried on this new system into their own development?
- Long-term moral and ethical effects of the technology
    - What longer-term projects did the technology inspire?
    - Have perspectives of other issues shifted because of this technology?
    - Has it helped or hindered human development worldwide or within certain regions?

These three main primary elements should determine the basic structure of your presentation; however, you are able to modify them as long as they keep the basic structure in place.

The conclusion of the presentation should contain no less than 2 ‘takeaway points’ that sum up your assessment of the technology. Ideally, these takeaway points should encapsulate your evaluation of the moral, ethical and technological effects of the technology you have examined, in line with the principles we have covered so far in the subject.

You will be assessed on the explanation and understanding of the development of the technology, and its emergence into the market. Your understanding on how this development adheres (or does not adhere) to the principles covered thus far in the subject will be marked as well.

#### Referencing
Referencing is essential for this assignment. A minimum of 6-8 references is required for this, including at least 4 academic sources. 

(An academic source is one that has been peer-reviewed, or cited in the past)

Your references will be evaluated in relevance to ensure that your arguments and justifications are based on sound reasoning and clear relevance.

Ensure that you reference according to the appropriate APA style, for citing and referencing information, as well as all appropriate research sources.

## Assessment 2
### Assessment Brief 2: **Solution Report**

Assessment: Proposed Solution Report
Length: 2,000 words with supporting images
Due Date: 09/11/2025

#### Summary: 
Select a recent technology development (last 10 years) and discuss how an aspect of this tech may have undermined its social, global or cultural impact. Then, discuss possible alternative solutions to address these concerns. The report should be 2K words in length and is a preparation for Assessment 3, which involves fully developing or concepting one of the solutions you propose as part of this assessment.

#### Context:
All developed technologies come with inherent side effects. Whether recent developments - such as the internet, mobile phones, or artificial intelligence - or older creations - such as the internal combustion engine (ICE), many often cause unintended consequences. Fossil fuel usage alongside ICEs have contributed to widespread warming of our planet, and mobile phone introduction has led to fundamental changes in how society communicates and receives information.

This Proposed Solution Report aims to assess your understanding of the side effects of your chosen technology. A further aim is to determine your ability to evaluate, break down and categorise these side effects. Alongside your chosen technology and referenced resources, you will ideally demonstrate your understanding of these complex issues.

Some examples of topics you could cover include:
- The development of the aeroplane and its ability to connect individuals globally, but also its ability to cause health or safety issues through rapid spread of illness.
- The development of the Internet and its ability to connect individuals globally, and the issues it can cause - in particular with areas of illegal or dangerous activities.
- The development of firewalling technology in conjunction with the Internet, and how it is used to block access to parts of the internet in different regions.

The topic chosen should be addressed and evaluated in detail, and an examination of the severity level of the flow-on effects documented. It should also propose solutions to the flow-on effects caused by the technology’s implementation. Note that the result of the report can highlight existing solutions that exist, but should go further in presenting additional solutions.

Please note: Keep in mind the solutions you discuss at the end of your report may become further developed or explained as part of assessment 3.

#### Instructions:
This assessment requires you to investigate a technology developed in the past 10 years, and determine how an aspect of that technology has undermined its social, global or cultural impact. As part of this report, you will also discuss possible solutions. As part of the analysis component, you will write a report that focuses on the following areas:
- The development of the technology, and the main effects.
    - Did the technology, while in development, inspire anything else before release?
    - Was it an easy development process, or perhaps more ethically complicated?
- The release of the technology, and the immediate ‘undermining’ effect its release may have had.
    - How quickly did society identify the issues with the technology?
    - How long did issues take to appear?
- Long-term undermining effects.
    - How long did these take to appear?
    - How ingrained are they in society now?
    - What long-term adjustments or changes occurred?
    - Were there restrictions implemented for the technology’s usage or future development?

#### Referencing
Referencing is essential for this assignment. A minimum of **10-12 references** is required for this, including at least **eight academic sources**.
(An academic source is one that has been peer-reviewed, or cited in the past)

References are marked in relevance to ensure that your arguments and justifications draw on sound reasoning and clear relevance.

**Ensure that you reference according to the appropriate APA style, for citing and referencing information, as well as all appropriate research sources.**

## Assessment 3
### Assessment Brief 3: **System Solution**

Assessment: System Solution - Report and Presentation
Length: 3,500 words
Due Date: 03/12/2025

#### Summary: 
Working in small groups, you are required to develop and submit two components for this assessment. There will be a Part A and Part B.

Part A: is a 3500-word report. Working in a group, you will select one person’s solution from Assessment 2, and you will work together to develop and elaborate on the system solution they identified in Assessment 2. You may only select one group member’s Assessment 2 solution.

Part B: will be an 8-14 minute presentation. Your presentation should highlight to the class (and the facilitator) the details of your system solution as detailed in your 3500 word report, and how well it deals with the issue identified in Assessment 2.

As a group, you are required to present and write the report. This means, each member of the group will present on one component of the System Solution, as well as write the relevant section of the report.

#### Context
As part of Assessment 2, you proposed a system solution. This solution should have addressed issues with an existing technology. As technology moves and changes, a next step is required - a full development of this solution. 

Regularly, changes to systems must have supporting evidence, to make sure that the changes are achieving their desired goal. Many companies require extensive vetting of changes before they adjust important services or structures.

Assessment 3 will evaluate your understanding of the scale of change required for the system that you have analysed in Assessment 2. Your explanation of the core issue(s), their fundamental causes, and the steps you take to stop, as well as prevent further issues, are the areas you will be assessed on. Furthermore, you will be assessed on your written and presentation skills.

This assessment helps to prepare you for undertaking similar projects in industry, where you must be able to analyse real issues in existing systems, and make recommendations based on your own original solutions to these identified issues. Developing solutions to these issues is of paramount importance, and can make the difference between success and catastrophic failure of an existing system.

#### Instructions
You will need to form groups to complete this assessment. Once you have formed a group (ideally 3-4 people depending on the size of the class) you should discuss which of your assessments (from Assessment 2) you will develop further for Assessment 3. Once you have come to a decision as a group, you will need to complete the following two components:

- Part A: A 3500 word report with equal contributions from the whole group.
- Part B: An 8-14 minute presentation that highlights to the class (and the facilitator) the details of your system solution, and how well it deals with the issue identified in Assessment 2. Again, you must all contribute to the presentation.

##### Part A: Report
The report should adhere to the following five-part structure:

1. Introduction / context:
This section of the report provides context for the issue. This should be no longer than one paragraph, and is only required for context of the issue under discussion.

2. Comprehensive issue breakdown:
As with the previous assessment, the issues from the technology discussed need to be highlighted. Ensure you clearly define the issues you are solving, and give reasons as to why you are not solving other potential issues.

3. System Solution proposal:
This section of the report should comprise the bulk of your writing. Here, a system is proposed, and it may differ based on the skillset within your team. Include images, technical diagrams, or code snippet examples as appropriate, to ensure you communicate your solution’s effectiveness appropriately.

4. Effectiveness prediction:
This section should be placed between the solution and the conclusion, and predict the effectiveness of your solution, based on previous examples implemented by other industry entities to solve similar problems. This should back up your previous justifications made during the report.

5. Conclusion:
This section should conclude your report.

##### Part B: Presentation
The 8-14 minute presentation should sum up the contents of your report, and provide any additional context or meaning that makes understanding the contents of the report easier. There should not be any material exclusive to either section - the report or the presentation.

##### Referencing
Referencing is essential for this assignment. A minimum of 10-12 references is required for this, including at least eight academic sources.

(An academic source is one that has been peer-reviewed, or cited in the past)

Your references are examined in relevance to ensure that your arguments and justifications are based on sound reasoning and clear relevance.

Ensure that you reference according to the appropriate APA style, for citing and referencing information, as well as all appropriate research sources.
