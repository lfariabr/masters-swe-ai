## Assessment 1
### Assessment Brief 1: **Research Presentation** 
Assessment: Presentation, Evolution of Technology
Length: 8-10 minutes
Due Date: 12/10/2025

#### Summary: 
Develop a presentation to discuss contemporary technology that has become public in the last 30 years, examining 2 major areas:
1 - How it challenges the existing moral and ethical framework of society
2 - Immediate effects on human understanding and knowledge
Presentation should last roughly 8-10 minutes and display a clear understanding of contemporary technology chosen.

#### Context:
Technology has evolved and changed drastically throughout the past 30 years. The evolution of the Internet and personal computers has led to incredible advances in connectivity and communication. Some examples of the many different changes that have occurred include - mobile phone accessibility, online communities and the development of social media. For this assessment you will select an area that you find compelling, that you can examine in depth.

The presentation should demonstrate my understanding and ability to evaluate the impact on society of the chosen technological advance, both through a moralistic or ethical lens and through a progressive lens. With my selected example and supporting material, I will examine and discuss the technology and its impact on society as a whole.

#### Instructions:
1. Investigate a technology development from the past 30 years, of your own choosing.
2. You must then determine the effects on society, through a moral and/or ethical lens.
3. You must consider the direct progressive effects, from a technical perspective - what that development inspired within the industry.
4. You will then create a presentation that follows a basic structure that seeks to investigate three primary elements (bullet points below). Within the three primary elements you may wish to answer the following questions:
- The technology itself
    - Can you measure its accessibility?
    - What moral or ethical issues did the development process have?
- Immediate effects of the development
    - When it launched - or became available - what happened in the first few years?
    - Did society have any issues with adopting this technology? How severe were they?
    - What changed within society after it became available?
    - What technologies carried on this new system into their own development?
- Long-term moral and ethical effects of the technology
    - What longer-term projects did the technology inspire?
    - Have perspectives of other issues shifted because of this technology?
    - Has it helped or hindered human development worldwide or within certain regions?

These three main primary elements should determine the basic structure of your presentation; however, you are able to modify them as long as they keep the basic structure in place.

The conclusion of the presentation should contain no less than 2 ‘takeaway points’ that sum up your assessment of the technology. Ideally, these takeaway points should encapsulate your evaluation of the moral, ethical and technological effects of the technology you have examined, in line with the principles we have covered so far in the subject.

You will be assessed on the explanation and understanding of the development of the technology, and its emergence into the market. Your understanding on how this development adheres (or does not adhere) to the principles covered thus far in the subject will be marked as well.

#### Referencing
Referencing is essential for this assignment. A minimum of 6-8 references is required for this, including at least 4 academic sources. 

(An academic source is one that has been peer-reviewed, or cited in the past)

Your references will be evaluated in relevance to ensure that your arguments and justifications are based on sound reasoning and clear relevance.

Ensure that you reference according to the appropriate APA style, for citing and referencing information, as well as all appropriate research sources.
