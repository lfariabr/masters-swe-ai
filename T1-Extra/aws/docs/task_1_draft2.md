Hi Lilly,

Thank you for your message and for giving us the opportunity to assess your current setup.

What you’re facing is a common challenge for companies growing fast and it’s a great signal!!!
We’ve had countless startups in the same position, and it’s always a turning point we're sure you'll love.

I’ve collaborated closely with our top Solutions Architects here at AWS to craft an infrastructure proposal that not only solves your pain points now but will scale with Fastier’s future growth.

I'd be delighted to make myself available any day next week to go through what we have prepared for you. When would be a good time for a 30-min sync next week? 
Feel free to reply here or use my link to schedule directly: calendly.com/luisfaria

You can take a sneak peek at the architecture here (diagram link) and find a simplified summary below:

---

**SUMMARY**

**Fastier Revamp Architecture – At a Glance**
- **Elastic Beanstalk:** PaaS for simplified deployment, zero-downtime updates, built-in auto-scaling and health checks.
- **EC2 Auto Scaling Groups:** Dynamically handle spikes and quiet periods; redundant across two availability zones.
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):** Ensures high availability, SSL termination, and lightning-fast response times.
- **RDS PostgreSQL:** Managed DB with backups, encryption, and failover support.
- **Amazon S3:** Secure, scalable static asset hosting for images, CSS, JS, etc.
- **AWS CodePipeline:** End-to-end CI/CD flow, including rollback + blue/green deployments.
- **Route 53:** High-availability DNS with traffic routing and failover.

**Migration Strategy**
1. Containerize your current Python web app
2. Set up Elastic Beanstalk environment
3. Migrate DB to RDS with minimal downtime
4. Implement CI/CD with CodePipeline
5. Gradual cutover to new infrastructure

Note: we’ve internally named this initiative “Fastier Architecture Revamp”, and we’d love to feature it in our AWS Success Stories series once live: https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies

Looking forward to helping Fastier scale with confidence!

Warm regards,
Luis Faria
