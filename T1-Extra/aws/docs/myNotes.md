### Task 1: Web Application Hosting ðŸ”¥ **IN PROGRESS**
- [X] Cross check ArchitectureDiagram.png with the task document 
- [X] Review AWS service descriptions in the task document

- [X] Write a summary of the client scenario to match understanding or even writing a debriefing context 
> "The client represents a brand that is growing consistently and is having some problems with the high demand: slow website during peak periods and server crashes due to memory overflow. The client is also experiencing some downtime during deployments and doesn't have a disaster recovery plan. 
We need to sedign an architecture that addresses these issues for their application which is a SPA React Application backed by Python and Flask, with PostgreSQL as a database. It all runs off a single AWS EC2 instance currently (t3.medium, 4GB of RAM)."
- [X] Draw a draft for the task thought process 
- [X] Draft the email to Lilly, including (`task_1_draft1.md` and `task_1_draft2.md`):

  - [X] Explanation of each AWS component
  - [X] Rationale for service choices
  - [X] Addressing client pain points (scalability, downtime, etc.)
- [X] Verify that the architecture diagram and the drafted solution are fully aligned
- [X] Proofread and finalize the email draft 
- [X] Write an article about the challenge
