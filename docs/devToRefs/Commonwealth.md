How I Tackled the Commonwealth's Bank Software Engineering Challenge
Tags: #dotnet #react #career #softwareengineering
While searching for the next task to tick off my daily diary, I stumbled across [Forage’s CBA Software Engineering challenge](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/commonwealth-bank/software-engineering-c4hw). 
Reading through it gave me goosebumps — and isn’t that feeling just amazing?

As a full-time student juggling casual jobs in construction and concierge services, I’ve been blessed with the flexibility to build my own schedule. Lately, I’ve been dedicating part of each day to challenges like these, and the compound effect has been incredible. So I thought I’d share my journey and learnings from completing this challenge.

## What the Program Included

The CBA team put together pre-recorded videos and example answers to guide participants through the challenge. It was self-paced, with clear explanations of what was expected in each task.

Here’s a quick rundown of the tasks:

### Task #1 – Backend

- **Modify an existing .NET backend**
- Set up and used C# to extend the goal model and controller

### Task #2 – Frontend

- **Modify an existing React/Redux frontend**
- Used TypeScript to extend the UI

### Task #3 – Fullstack

- **Modify client requests**
- Worked with TypeScript and Axios to make POST and GET requests

### Task #4 – Testing

- **Cover your code!**
- Used C# (xUnit) to unit test changes to the goal controller

### Task #5 – PR

- **Display everything on GitHub**
- Created a new branch, committed, pushed changes, and wrote clear PR descriptions

## What I Learned

### Backend

**C#** – Never used it before! Learned how to install, run, compile, and understand .NET architecture as used in large institutions.  
**MongoDB** – Reconfigured a fresh server and cluster, and connected it from scratch.  
**Swagger** – Had used it in the past, but revisited it to test API endpoints after changes.  
**Version control** – Committed everything into my [Master’s SWE AI repo](https://github.com/lfariabr/masters-swe-ai).

### Frontend

**React/Redux with TypeScript** – Gained insights into how large institutions structure their frontend architectures.  
**Custom emoji picker** – Implemented this feature into the React app.  
**Axios** – Used for POST, GET, and handling requests for adding, updating, or removing emojis.

### Testing

**xUnit** in C# – Noticed the similarity between `[Fact]` in xUnit and `assert` in pytest or `expect` in Jest.
