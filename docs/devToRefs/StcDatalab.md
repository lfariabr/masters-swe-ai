I've heard this awesome phrase this week and decided it would illustrate this article about my first Microsoft SQL Server experience. Buckle up, I hope you enjoy the ride!

## Context

I recently received a message from a friend of mine asking if I have worked with Microsoft SQL server. The company he works for was actively looking for someone and was having a hard time finding the right candidate.

Given that I have a strong background with data pipelines, ETL processes, and data engineering practices, I felt confident in my ability to contribute effectively.

I have experience managing data using PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB and GraphQL databases at work. I understand schema, reporting, pipeline, queries, stored procedures, backup, and optimization and while not having directly worked in Microsoft SQL Server, I know it is a matter of adjusting to the syntax to get it going.
