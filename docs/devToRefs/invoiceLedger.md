## 🎯 The Challenge:
### When Excel Becomes a Bottleneck

One of my recent jobs has put me through being an Assistant Building Manager. A little bit different from the last time I was a concierge for the same company [Link to dev.to article about insights for being a concierge: Apt Lift Finder, myRoster, excelPilot](http//:dev.to...), this time I was introduced to a whole new variety of information, listening to a bloke who has 25+ experience at Waterco dealing with pools (Warehousing, distribution, chemicals. Big stuff) and 4+ years experience at Building Management.

Imagine the amount of knowledge I was suddenly allowed to access on an hourly basis - the guy likes to talk, and so motherfucking do I.
To bring some seasoning *(we say that in Brazil to mean that we're adding an extra)* to the article, here are a few of the subjects I've been through with him on a granular level:

Stakeholder management: Owners Corporation, Real-Estate Agents, Residents, Committee members, Contractors, Assistant
Civil Engineering: Slab, concrete, plumbing, leaking, fire, pumps, pipes, water tanks, sewage
Assessments: AFSS, Pest Control,
Project management: 
    - Residents: think about leak complaint -> pre-diagnosis -> select trusted contractor -> bring in -> receive diagnosis -> if >aud 1k, approve, otherwise, proceed, even though accounts could have been questioned -> execute -> validate -> deliver
    Contractors: plumbers, engineers, desentupidores, locksmith, pest control, on-demand (according to OC's point)
    Owners Corporation: receive task -> diagnose -> return -> if approved, execute / if refused, re-do
    Strata: shared responsibilities, but mostly strata is responsible for budgeting and "kind of" legal

Legal: dealing with a massive claim against sydney transport and another one against winten corporation (a huge construction company) due to building deffects from 8-10 years ago

Things we could measure:
- resident's feedback
- owner's corporation feedback
- hire big firm of lawyers to analyze both massive projects
- think about raising the flag for excelBM's support (subsidio para o southbank)

I got my hands on a construction company's financial ledger—a massive Excel file with multiple sheets (one per building), each containing hundreds of invoices spanning years of contractor work.
