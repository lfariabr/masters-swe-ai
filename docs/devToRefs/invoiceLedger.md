## Introduction
### Dipping the toes into water

One of my recent jobs has put me through being an Assistant Building Manager. A little bit different from the last time I was a concierge for the same company where I wrote about [Engineering Principles Applied to Daily Life: Concierge Edition](https://dev.to/lfariaus/engineering-principles-applied-to-daily-life-concierge-edition-1cjh), [myRoster: from copypaste to 2-minute submissions](https://dev.to/lfariaus/myroster-from-copypaste-to-2-minute-submissions-dao) and [Custom Conversation API with OpenAi](https://github.com/lfariabr/excel-pilot) this time I was introduced to a whole new variety of information, listening to a bloke who has 25+ experience at Waterco dealing with pools (Warehousing, distribution, chemicals. Big stuff) and 4+ years experience at Building Management.

Imagine the amount of knowledge I was suddenly allowed to access on an hourly basis - the guy likes to talk, and so fucking do I.
To bring some seasoning *(we say that in Brazil to mean that we're adding an extra)* to the article, here are a few of the subjects I've been through with him on a granular level:

- Stakeholder management: Owners Corporation, Real-Estate Agents, Residents, Committee members, Contractors, Assistant
- Civil Engineering: Slab, concrete, plumbing, leaking, fire, pumps, pipes, water tanks, sewage
- Regulations and Commitments: AFSS, Pest Control,
- Project management: 
    - Residents: think about leak complaint -> pre-diagnosis -> select trusted contractor -> bring in -> receive diagnosis -> if >aud 1k, approve, otherwise, proceed, even though accounts could have been questioned -> execute -> validate -> deliver
    - Contractors: plumbers, engineers, desentupidores, locksmith, pest control, on-demand (according to OC's point)
    - Owners Corporation: receive task -> diagnose -> return -> if approved, execute / if refused, re-do
    - Strata: shared responsibilities, but mostly strata is responsible for budgeting and "kind of" legal
- Legal: dealing with a massive claim against sydney transport and another one against winten corporation (a huge construction company) due to building deffects from 8-10 years ago

Things we could measure:
- Resident's feedback
- Owner's corporation feedback
- Hire big firm of lawyers to analyze both massive projects
- Think about raising the flag for excelBM's support (subsize the lawyer for SB?)
