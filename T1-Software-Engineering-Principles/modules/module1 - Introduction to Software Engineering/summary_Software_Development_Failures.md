# Software Development Failures  
*(Kweku Ewusi-Mensah, 2003)*

Kweku Ewusi-Mensah dissects why software projects fail despite decades of experience. This reading reflects on large-scale IT failures and emphasizes recurring patterns.

## 🔑 Key Points:

- **Failure is Still Common**: Even with tools, frameworks, and agile methodologies, many software projects still fail to deliver.

### Contributing Factors:
- Vague or Shifting Requirements
- Lack of User Involvement
- Inadequate Planning or Testing
- Unrealistic Timelines and Budgets

### Failure Modes:
- Partial delivery (only a subset of features work)
- Cost/time overruns
- Total abandonment

## 🔍 Relevance to ClinicTrendsAI:

As the project handles real clinic data, unclear requirements or failure to define what “success” looks like (e.g., prediction accuracy, user uptake) could derail development. Early and constant engagement with stakeholders (clinic managers, analysts) helps reduce this risk.
