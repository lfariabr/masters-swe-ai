## 🧠 Machine Learning Architecture

### Multi-Model Ensemble Approach

ClinicTrends AI implements **4 distinct ML pipelines** for comprehensive sentiment analysis:

#### **Model 1: Comment-Based Classification**
```python
# TfidfVectorizer + LogisticRegression on Comment text
Pipeline: Raw Comments → TF-IDF Vectorization → Logistic Regression → Sentiment Classification
Features: 5,000 TF-IDF features with English stop-word filtering
Performance: Optimized for text-only sentiment detection
```

#### **Model 2: Enhanced Comment-Score Fusion**
```python
# TfidfVectorizer + LogisticRegression on Comment + NPS Score
Pipeline: Comments + Scores → Feature Fusion → TF-IDF → Classification
Innovation: Combines textual and numerical features for improved accuracy
Use Case: Holistic sentiment analysis incorporating quantitative feedback
```

#### **Model 3: Transformer-Enhanced Classification**
```python
# Hugging Face Transformers + Custom Training
Pipeline: Comments → DistilBERT → Fine-tuned Classification → Ensemble Prediction
Technology: State-of-the-art transformer models (DistilBERT-base-uncased)
Advantage: Context-aware sentiment understanding with transfer learning
```

#### **Model 4: Hybrid Transformer-Score Integration (Prototype)**
```python
# Advanced fusion of Transformers + Numerical Features
Pipeline: Comments + Scores → Transformer Encoding → Feature Fusion → Classification
Innovation: Combines transformer embeddings with numerical NPS data
Result: Highest accuracy through multi-modal learning approach
```

*Note: Transformer-based models have been integrated for experimentation and performance benchmarking but were not part of the original MVP scope defined in the IEEE SRS.*

### Performance Benchmarking Framework

```python
def collect_metrics(y_true, y_pred, model_name):
    """Comprehensive model evaluation with industry-standard metrics"""
    metrics = {
        "Accuracy": accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred),
        "Precision": precision_recall_fscore_support(y_true, y_pred)[0].mean(),
        "Recall": precision_recall_fscore_support(y_true, y_pred)[1].mean(),
        "F1-Score": precision_recall_fscore_support(y_true, y_pred)[2].mean()
    }
    return metrics
```
