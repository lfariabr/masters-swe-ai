0. Key concept
"Does it make sense to use NPS as a benchmark vs sentimnent analysis?"
1. TF-IDF vs Transformers
“What situations are TF-IDF models still useful for?”
“When should I prefer transformers over classical ML?”
2. Combining Text + Numeric Data
“What’s the best way to integrate numeric scores with transformer embeddings?”
3. Model Evaluation
“Is accuracy the best metric for sentiment tasks, or should I focus on precision/recall?”
4. Deployment and Scalability
“What’s your experience deploying ML models in production?”
“How to keep response times low with transformers?”
5. Data Volume
“Is my dataset size (~25,000 rows) enough to fine-tune transformers?”
6. Teacher’s Background
“What projects have you done with NLP?”
“What challenges have you faced deploying ML models?”
