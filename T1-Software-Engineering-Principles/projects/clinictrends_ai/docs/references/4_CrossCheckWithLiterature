# Cross-Check with Literature (as Dr. Ranju Suggested)

Literature provides a foundation to validate our 80% accuracy on the 30K+ NPS dataset for an aesthetic clinic, with insights tailored to health and care contexts.

- **Strengths**: NPS’s simplicity and focus on extremes (promoters vs. detractors) make it actionable, supporting our 80% as a practical achievement. Press Ganey (2024) highlights its value as a relationship metric in healthcare, relevant to clinic loyalty.

- **Critiques**: Some studies argue NPS lacks predictive power over metrics like satisfaction scores, especially in healthcare where clinical outcomes matter. For aesthetic clinics, this is amplified—patient loyalty may hinge more on visual results than survey responses, suggesting our model might miss subtle sentiment shifts (e.g., passives becoming detractors post-procedure).

- **Improvement Levers**: Literature emphasizes feature engineering (e.g., procedure type, patient age) and text analysis (e.g., sentiment drivers like “natural look”) to boost accuracy. Viseven (2025) suggests AI-powered tools for dynamic surveys, aligning with our dataset’s potential. Integrating NPS with electronic health records (per SurveyMonkey) could enhance outcome tracking.

**Critical Reflection**: The healthcare narrative often glorifies NPS (e.g., Mayo Clinic’s 70) as a loyalty indicator, but aesthetic clinics face unique pressures—e.g., social media influence and outcome sensitivity—that literature underaddresses. The 2025 Retently benchmark (+53) shows progress, yet lacks clinic-specific depth. As of 10:42 AM AEST, August 08, 2025, no studies fully bridge this gap, suggesting our cross-check should prioritize real-world feedback (e.g., X posts) over generic healthcare data.

> Notes: These sources highlight NPS’s strengths (e.g., Press Ganey’s relationship focus) and critiques (e.g., SurveyMonkey’s nuanced insights), but the literature’s general healthcare bias may miss aesthetic-specific factors like social media influence. The 2025 Relias data supports real-time feedback, yet clinic-specific studies remain absent.
