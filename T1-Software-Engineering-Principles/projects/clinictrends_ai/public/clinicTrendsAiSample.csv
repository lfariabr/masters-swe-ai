2/07/2022 8:48,4,Store A,2022,"The employee who applied the injections to me arrived 20 minutes late, didn't say anything about the delay, wanted to hurry up and end the session early. I was in unreal pain, even crying, she never tried to calm me down or be polite. She said the session lasts 20 minutes, I should decide whether to continue or stop.

2/07/2022 8:49,7,Store A,2022,"Good morning. I would like the clinic to call the person 1 day before the appointment to confirm the person's attendance and to remind them. I am having my knees and elbows whitened in 3 sessions. I did the second one and I still am not seeing the desired results. I found the products to be too weak for the stain. These products are more for whitening the face and not knees and elbows. Thank you, Sandra Pinheiro dos Santos"

2/07/2022 8:50,8,Store B,2022,The unit's staff does not interact with customers. Everything is limited to providing a quote.

2/07/2022 8:52,10,Store A,2022,"Very bad reception team, disorganized, excellent therapist Nat√°lia, I only got better with her, the others I did not get any! Just think, I only had 2 appointments with them, if I had more, there would have been an improvement in the blemish on my face."

2/07/2022 8:53,6,Store D,2022,It was incredibly difficult to get back in touch with the Tijuca unit to schedule the session. The unit does not have the equipment I used to start the treatment in Tijuca. I was seen late and the professional presented me poorly for a beauty company.
2/07/2022 8:54,10,Store A,2022,The professional who attended to me was excellent. I would even like to have future sessions with her.
2/07/2022 8:54,10,Store C,2022,"Excellent service, super polite girls. However, the procedure is not having any effect (tattoo removal). I noticed that there are several complaints about the same case from the company. I feel like I'm throwing my money away üòî"
