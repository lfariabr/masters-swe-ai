## üìå Project Title

**ClinicTrendsAI**: A Predictive Dashboard for Customer Satisfaction for Local Business

---

## üß© Problem Description

Local businesses rely heavily on customer satisfaction for growth and retention. Despite collecting regular feedback through surveys, these insights are often underutilized or manually reviewed too late to prevent client churn or service dips.

### Specific Mapped Out Issues
- No automated system exists to track client sentiment trends over time  
- Stores can‚Äôt anticipate service breakdowns or drop in satisfaction until it‚Äôs too late  
- Decision-makers often lack data-driven tools to link performance metrics with real-time feedback

### Sub-Issues
- Difficulty recognizing recurring issues across multiple locations  
- Manual survey analysis leads to missed early warning signs  
- Inability to forecast future satisfaction metrics based on past performance

---

## üí° Proposed Solution

### Overview

**ClinicTrendsAI** is a lightweight analytics dashboard powered by real-world survey data from local businesses. It ingests historical NPS-style feedback and applies machine learning to predict customer satisfaction trends across clinics, helping managers make smarter, proactive decisions.

### Key Features
- Upload CSV files of survey data (supporting timestamps, ratings, optional comments)  
- Visualize trends in satisfaction over weeks, months, quarters  
- Forecast future satisfaction using regression-based ML models  
- Identify leading indicators of drop-offs (e.g., clinic location, service type)  
- Generate downloadable insights for stakeholder meetings  

### Business Value

ClinicTrendsAI empowers managers to act before client satisfaction declines, improving retention and service quality. It reduces reliance on gut feeling, introduces predictive decision-making, and encourages a data-first culture across the business.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Plan

### Software Process Model

**Agile** methodology is chosen due to its flexibility and iterative structure, which suits evolving insights from user feedback and ML experimentation.

### Timeline and Activities

| Phase                    | Weeks | Activities                                                      |
|--------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Requirements & Planning  | 1‚Äì3    | Define key metrics, user stories, feature scope                 |
| Design & Dataset Setup   | 4‚Äì6    | Prepare sample survey data, design UI wireframes, select model  |
| Development              | 7‚Äì10   | Build frontend dashboard, backend prediction engine, integrate charts |
| Testing & Evaluation     | 11     | Validate accuracy, test with sample data, refine UI             |
| Presentation             | 12     | Prepare summary, present insights and demo tool                 |

### Justification

The Agile approach allows continuous testing of ML model assumptions and UI design changes as new insights are discovered. Its sprint structure aligns with SEP401 milestones and encourages fast and dynamic feedback.
