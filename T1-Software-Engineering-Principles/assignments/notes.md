## Context
I made the way whole around... I got the briefing and jumped STRAIGHT INTO THE CODE!
Now that I'm here, I'm starting to understand better the steps taken and how fascinating is to observe that I was already balls deep into the code without even understanding the full scope of the project - this is MAGIC!
