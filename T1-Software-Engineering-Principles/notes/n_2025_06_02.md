# Me sharing about Managing Late Requirements
Hi everyone,

Yesterday in class, we briefly touched on a challenge that many of us probably faced (or will, haha): what to do when new requirements show up after we have already passed the requirements gathering stage and find ourselves in design, implementation, testing or deployment... managing late requirements is huge!

In my experience, this happens more often than we'd like and I believe it should be treated as a red flag. Late stage requirements changes can have a domino effect, impacting testing scope, delivery timeline, client trust...

These situations are tricky, specially when the project has already been scoped, sold or is under a tight deadline. That's why I mentioned I try to document meeting notes diligently, especially during initial discovery and having interactions with the stakeholders.

I also like to highlight potential risks, dependencies and confused/invalidated assumptions. These notes become kind of my satefy net when a new requirement shows up later and threatens the project's plans.

One template that has followed me over the years is a simple "Follow Up" spreadsheet that I'm sharing here. This helped me keep projects focused and the expectations clean.Â 




I hope it helps!
